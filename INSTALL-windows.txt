How to install Lima for windows:

1) Uncompress this package and move/rename the folder so that the folders like bin and lib 
   are in c:\lima

2) Use wordpad to edit c:\lima\bin\config.lima.win32 and change the mudname

3) Double-click on c:\lima\win32\mud.bat

4) telnet to localhost 7878

5) Log in to your mud.  Make sure you're the first person to do so --
   whoever is first will become an admin!  After that, new users will
   just be guest wizards (by default).

   Connect to the mud, type a name, password, etc.  Once you are logged
   in, you should be a full admin.  To verify this, type:
	checkpriv 1

   It should come back with:
	Verified.  You have privilege '1'

   In order to access all the admin commands, you will need to type:
	resetpath

6) Creating new admins;

   You can convert other wizards after they log in into admins by adding
   them into the "admin" domain.  Use the "admtool" command for this.

7) Mudlib configuration:

   Change any options you feel appropriate in /include/config.h. 

   When you're done with any configuration changes, then shut down the
   mud with the shutdown command.  Restart it, as described above, to
   make those changes happen.

8) You're done! Share your experiences on the Lima area of http://lpmuds.net/forum
