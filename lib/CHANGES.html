<DT><em>Mon Dec  2 04:56:17 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> cleaned up DID_D somewhat and fixed the bug where a didlog with one entry would always print (it now checks the last didlog time).<p>

<DD> tweaked the arg processing in the news reader.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  2 05:35:58 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>

<DT><em>Mon Dec  2 05:38:57 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> moved the other /std/adt files to /contrib. They weren't used either. Nuke the /std/adt directory.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  2 08:31:15 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed 'update' to deal better with virtual objects/.scr files<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  2 13:44:00 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added cwd support to set_objects()<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  2 15:09:22 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added /domains/lpscript, including a copy of the wizroom written in LPscript<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec  4 15:36:49 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added a /cmds/create dir<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec  4 16:01:15 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added an interface to CMD_D to allow command inheritables to be in the /cmds dir without being seen as commands.  See /cmds/create/scr_command for details of the imp.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec  4 16:43:08 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added 'newroom' and 'describeroom'<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec  4 16:52:21 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> note: use 'addpath /cmds/create' and 'rehash' to use the new commands<p>

<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 11:23:42 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> fixed CFILE to append .scr or .c if appropriate<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 11:58:28 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 12:08:23 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added /domains/2.4.5 [no, this isn't a joke :-)]<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 12:47:34 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> moved cmd_d.c.old back to cmd_d.c, it *was* a working copy.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 14:09:35 1996</em>: <strong>Zakk</strong>
<DD> refuse to have gotten out my asbestos undies for nothing!<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 14:09:35 1996</em>: <strong>Zakk</strong>
<DD> want to see a decent flame!<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 14:11:48 1996</em>: <strong>Zakk</strong>
<DD> had a mouse fart. Rock on<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 15:40:36 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> cleaned up format_time(), fixed a bug involving zero seconds, and added a new format<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec  5 15:45:35 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> made idle in the descs use convert_time<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec  6 05:15:14 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed die() not to recurse; side effect: you can't use set_hp() to reincarnate people anymore.  Use reincarnate() [that was always the correct way, but ...]<p>
<DT><em>Sat Dec  7 18:58:55 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed query_posessive->query_possessive() in /std/object/description.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Dec  7 19:58:41 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed admtool not to nuke unless the user exists.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Dec  7 23:10:11 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed trans to autolook when you move<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 03:24:59 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> cleaned out some old crap in /secure/user.c<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 04:03:29 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> allowed wizardp() and adminp() to take no args (implying current user)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 04:10:22 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added get_user_variable(string varname) as a simul. no more need for talking to the shell object directly.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 04:11:08 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated a bunch of mudlib code to use get_user_variable()<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 04:35:44 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated a lot of the help to use "$$ see: x, y, z" instead of SEE ALSO in the text. "$$ see" lets the help system auto-generate "see also" text. Also allows for creation of hyperlinks if we auto-build help web pages.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 04:54:05 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the mudlib to do query_shell_ob() off the user, not the body.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 05:03:15 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> cleaned up global.h some. Also cleaned some old funcs out of body.c<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 05:05:45 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> removed the "catching_scrollback" stuff from the body (since it was a no-op). The right stuff needs to be added to the user ob for it to work.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 05:40:33 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> misfired a lot.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 05:40:53 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> looked like a fool in the face of the mighty wrath of Deathblade.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 06:10:28 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the help_d to properly count pending items so it knew when it was done. the (new) directory-ignore stuff messed it up.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 06:10:58 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> made the help system case-insensitive<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 06:18:50 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> cleaned up the flags, removing a lot of unneeded functionality.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 06:57:37 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the "multiple message" bug in msg/review. Actually review displayed multiple messages due to a bug in M_MESSAGES returning duplicates from query_msg_types().<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 07:25:22 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the "ansi" command not to turn on "WHITE" after the RESET. Some people have white backgrounds :-)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 07:27:36 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> tweaked the "ls" command also, in terms of WHITE, but it needs more work.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 07:33:14 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added prompts to modal_simple(). Allows people to escape while in a modal_simple() and return to a prompt.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 07:33:37 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> simplified the "passwd" code to use modal_simple() rather than pushing an input context.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 08:12:06 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the "stat" command and all the stat_me() functions to return a string rather than directly writing. You may need to wait for some modules/objects to update.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 18:31:33 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> raided Dead Souls for the "qtip" emote.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 21:14:19 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> whacked Valention's MONEY_D hard (kept area concept, but axed/rewrote the rest). Installed it as the current MONEY_D. Rewrote admtool's money handling.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec  9 21:15:39 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> revised a lot of admtool's input handling to be a bit more standardized. Created an empty guild administration area. Moved the help rebuild into a misc admin area. Adjusted much of the privs to be only Mudlib:daemons rather than 1 (since the daemons holding the data are in Mudlib:daemons anyhow). Misc admtool tweaks.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 00:07:03 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> moved admtool's do_xxx_args() functions to M_INPUT as input_xxx_args().<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 00:51:20 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed codesay to use NO_ANSI. Unfortunately, it can't use simple_action() any more for issuing the message...<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 00:55:09 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> revised /std/menu to use input_one_arg() where necessary. Also fixed it to use modal_simple() in some places rather than modal_func() all the time.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 00:55:39 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed query_shell_ob() references in plmenu and iftp_ob.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 00:56:56 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> revised plmenu to use player command more often (rather than dup'ing code). Changed to use input_one_arg rather than get_input_then_call.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 01:45:49 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> made LOG_D timestamp banishes<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 02:35:51 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> upgraded the BANISH_D to record the reason within the data file. Updated admtool's banish code to display reasons and to enforce needing a reason for a banish.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 03:12:45 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added type 3 to convert_time() to produce "6h 12m 56s"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 03:12:59 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated the locate and who replies to format the time nicely.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 03:43:27 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> changed do_looking() in rooms to take an optional argument which specifies who is doing the looking.  This makes body->force_look() work properly, instead of always making this_body() look.  (This was the problem w/ trans)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 10:20:19 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed idfind to work ... It may have been broken for years :) (it used ' "arg" ')<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 10:28:58 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed apropos to display nicely.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 11:28:52 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> added query/set_plural to /std/object/names and ripped it from the stairs.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 11:41:08 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed 'scan' to not ALWAYS be deep after someone uses scan -d<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 10 12:16:03 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> lowercased all logs with the exception of "QUESTS" which he couldn't find a ref. to.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Dec 11 07:30:37 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> added the points back into the quest_d, appear the data was gone.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 00:04:18 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in goto: it assumed that only constants would be returned for a move (hence would fail if release_object() or receive_object() returned a string)<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 00:05:11 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> "fixed" the release_object() bug in complex_container where receive_object in the environment would hose you. This fix should be fixed (See lima.todo)<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 00:06:09 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> put back the code (well .. uncommented) in the car_wash - you now can't leave the car (actually trying to "goto" there will produce an incorrect message ... LWI - it's to be expected)<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 02:43:30 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in the master's error_handler() where it queried a userid from a user ob where one hadn't been set yet.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 16:45:29 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed the 2.4.5 elevator<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 17:37:19 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added 'dive' as a syn for 'swim'<p>
<DT><em>Thu Dec 12 22:16:16 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed exits to use format_list()<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 02:56:39 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added a skill maintainance section to admtool.  Note that adding a skill adds its parents, too.  Removing a skill also removes its subskills.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 02:59:21 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> improved the look of the "skills" command.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 05:25:02 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated test_skill() to automatically learn based on success/failure and based on comparitive skill levels. Also updated training points to be awarded on a decreasing basis relative to current skill level.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 09:47:29 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> moved /domains/2.4.5 to /domains/std/2.4.5 [mostly because secure_d barfs about a name starting with something numeric]<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 10:18:11 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> connected the 2.4.5 domain to the Grand Hall via the church elevator<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 17:15:18 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed the wizroom so that the quiet room is to the northeast (on the north, it clashes with the portal)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 20:17:59 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> changed news so that groups have a read and a write restriction. admin.* is admin only read/write, wiz.* is wiz only read/write, ..announcements.. is anyone read, admin only write. Along the way, the two posts in ..ann.. got hosed. life's like that.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 21:09:39 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in /domains/std/pet. It now clones.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 13 21:56:55 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in snoop() ... it ws bugging due to the adminp() change<p>
<DT><em>Sat Dec 14 03:37:57 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated skill advancement to follow a curve where it is initially difficult to gain skill, it is relatively easy during the middle, and difficult as you reach perfection. Also known as "Ohara's Bathtub Curve" :-)<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 04:32:12 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> cleaned up some naming in M_DAMAGE_SOURCE to reflect what they really mean.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 04:32:45 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> whacked LOG_D and /trans/cmds/shutdown.c to have LOG_D timestamp the lines, rather than doing it all over (inconsistently) in the shutdown cmd.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 05:47:38 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added /std/body/skills::query_evaluation() to return the player's current (global) evaluation of their skills.  The comparison is their skill total relative to config.h::EVALUATION_SKILL_LEVEL.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 05:48:08 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated the "stats" command to contain the real evaluation and to fix a number of problems based on the USE_xxx symbols.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 05:49:47 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> shifted some combat functions from /std/race up to /std/body. Races can override if necessary, but body is more appropriate.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 05:50:51 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> wanted to note the funcs were: to_hit_base, damage_bonus, and hit_skill<p>
<DT><em>Sun Dec 15 09:50:09 1996</em>: <strong>Zac</strong>
<DD> am bored.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 20 19:12:34 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> cleaned up the front end of the login process a bit; routines in /secure/user now are prepended with the module name, making it easier to see where one is jumping to; also serieses of prompts are done continuation passing style so one can simply read down one routine to follow the process.  Also removed some duplicated code and unnecessary class to existing_user_enter_game in sw_body.c (superceded by sw_body_handle_existing_logon)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 20 19:23:00 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> cleaned up and modified enter_game() a bit.  Major change: you now get moved to the start location and announced *before* reading the didlog stuff; this means if you use ! from the didlog prompt things are a bit more sane.  The forced look is now the only thing delayed till after the didlog prompt<p>
<DT><em>Sat Dec 21 02:20:49 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added PLAYER_INFO_IS_PUBLIC to config.h and fixed up FINGER_D to filter out email, real name, home page, and connect-from for non-admins if PLAYER_INFO_IS_PUBLIC is not defined. Otherwise, the info is available to all users (subject to the '#' restrictions, which admins always bypass, regardless).<p>
<DT><em>Sat Dec 21 02:21:38 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> also fixed a bug with I3 fingering a non-existent user; it bugged rather than returning an error packet.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 27 01:48:40 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> tweaked the start room a touch, replacing 5 exits with 1 default exit :)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 27 01:59:26 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> changed hidden exits so that "all" will work with set/add/remove. Note: This will set _all_ exits (including up and down), and not just the exits that the room has (easier this way). add_he("all") is identical in effect to set, and rem will clear all<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 27 19:56:33 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> made open and close ignore objects in other peoples inventory<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 27 20:17:22 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> added a query_uwield_message to m_wieldable, also added a do_remove to m_wieldable to allow unwield (the verb) to work.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 27 20:17:40 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> modified /std/base/monster/wield.c to print an unwield message<p>
<DT><em>Fri Dec 27 20:58:07 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> made eat foo not try and take an item from someone elses inventory.  also made a default message for eat_action.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Dec 30 10:15:46 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added BIRTHDAY_D.  Flames to /dev/null :-)  Use BIRTHDAY_D->add_birthday(<your login>, "Jan 12").<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 31 10:50:15 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> rearranged the inherits in /std/monster to make them more straight-forward<p>
<DT><em>Tue Dec 31 12:55:19 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed the wizroom desc.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jan  1 10:59:13 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> changed M_MESSAGES::inform() to use MSG_INDENT for all messages, not just the 'others' part.  Fixes Drakor's soul indentation bug.  Also means that all multi-line messages going through the message module will have indented continution lines; not sure if this is desired.  Might need an flag to inform() to enable/disable it.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Jan  2 16:30:48 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed the dock wall to use a secret door ... navigation room side still needs to be fixed.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jan  5 13:43:24 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the ports that HTTP_D and FTP_D (from ports.h). HTTP is now at PORT+3 (7881) and FTP is at PORT+4 (7882). Also shifted the files up from /include/net to just /include. deleted /include/net and its special priv. A couple other minor tweaks.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jan  5 13:57:00 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed up various references to HTTP_PORT throughout the lib (they're now PORT_HTTP)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 00:04:52 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed up the navigation room/wall/button a little ...<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 08:36:05 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> installed Valentino's (fixed) mudlist cgi.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 15:20:29 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added a 'room_short' configurable colour (defaults to "none")<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 15:39:52 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed MORE_OB not to error when you su<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 15:40:30 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> moved some code to ANSI_D; legacy use of i_use_ansi() and ansi() should be fixed<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 16:31:48 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed the labyrinth.  Someone changed the virtual server's create() to a setup(), which is bad since it is a daemon ...<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan  6 16:40:48 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed base_room::create() to pass extra args (if any) to setup()<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan  7 12:32:24 1997</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> put Valentino's homepage_d into /contrib, creates a page with links to the wizards pages<p>
<DT><em>Wed Jan  8 23:36:36 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed up the dock wall/navigation wall code<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jan 11 03:15:31 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> started moving towards some simplification of the FINGER_D by introducing CLASS_FINGER and FINGER_D::get_finger_data().  The IMUD_D uses it now, but other functions will migrate to it (and push presentation scheme out of FINGER_D).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jan 12 20:25:19 1997</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made a mudlib fix to a security hole that should really be fixed in the driver, but hey.  Thanks to Burty for pointing it out.  Grab a new /secure/master.c if you want the fix for your mud.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan 13 00:40:31 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added canonical_path() to simul_efun/path.c, then changed master.c::valid_read/write to use it (and removing Rust's temp hack).<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan 13 02:33:47 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> split FINGER_D::show_big_finger() into two funcs: one for in-mud and one for the web.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan 13 02:34:46 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> fixed the "finger" command and the "who" WWW gateway to use the new FINGER_D::get_finger_data() function. The two commands now do the formatting appropriate for their display mechanism.  get_finger() was rm'd from FINGER_D.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 01:39:17 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> moved the vsupport inherit up to BASE_OBJ and removed from OBJ, SPARSE_OBJ, and LESS_SPARSE_OBJ<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 02:15:18 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> changed /std/non-room.c to /std/non_room.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 02:15:47 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> want to note that that is normally used as NON_ROOM anyhow, so it shouldn't be noticeable.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 02:22:03 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> removed parsedsc.c from /std/room (wicked old obsolete bugger)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 02:23:47 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> moved nntp.c and telet_ob.c to /contrib<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 02:37:01 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> moved LESS_SPARSE_OBJ to /obj/simple_ob.c (SIMPLE_OB) and SPARSE_OBJ to /obj/fake_item_mgr.c (FAKE_ITEM_MGR). These are never subclassed. They aren't even directly used (they're handled via M_ITEMS). The new names better reflect what they do. Comments have been added to the objects.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 22:24:41 1997</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> fixed grep to use glob style patterns instead of regexp patterns<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 14 22:30:08 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>

<DT><em>Fri Jan 17 10:26:36 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed save_to_string() to preserve inventory relationships; it used deep_inventory() instead of recursing, which flattened them.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jan 17 11:40:02 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> changed a few things aboout ls: (1) colour depends on the "colour-ls" var.  Try 'set colour-ls'.  (2) The table formatting takes colour into account.  (3) It uses this_user()->query_screen_width() instead of being hardcoded to 79<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jan 17 11:46:25 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed ls colours to be configurable (assuming CONFIGURABLE_COLOURS)<p>

<DT><em>Fri Jan 17 12:45:56 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added an admtool interface for ANSI_D (this is the correct way to add new %^ codes)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jan 17 13:32:13 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> : The mad ANSI advocate has struck again: news colour now exists (and is configurable) [Hey, wasn't that the same guy who didn't want Lima to look like a Christmas tree?  What the heck is he doing??]<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jan 17 13:47:06 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> made it so that IMUD channels can be a different colour if you want (btw, this shows that one can define colours in terms of other colours; the default for channel_imud is "channel")<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jan 19 23:20:28 1997</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> installed Myth's fixes to ftp_d and socket, which fix binary transfers and max buf size transfers. See file comments for more info<p>
<DT><em>Mon Jan 20 22:45:53 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> put in a tempfix for a bug in give, where giving a worn object would give the give message but not move the item.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 21 05:35:56 1997</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> installed Myth's version of imud who that removes invisible people<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 21 09:11:28 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Tue Jan 21 12:21:36 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> moved M_INPUT to /secure/modules<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 21 15:38:32 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added a new cleaner admtool, which is started via admtool -n.  Currently only the security submenu exists.  Added as a separate option so the old one is there in case this one has problems (esp. with a release imminent)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jan 21 17:45:11 1997</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> added currency, quest, domain to the new admtool<p>
