<DD> notes that he added the following to m_exit_obj.c: alias_prep(srcprep, destprep) which copies all settings to the destprep (throws an error if destprep already exists), and setup_default_prep_aliases() which now only calls alias_prep("in", "into"), alias_prep("on", "onto") ONLY if the destination prepositions don't exist..<p>

<DD> modified banishing.  People with logins from banished sites can no longer log in if the site is banished unless the user is registered to log in from that site.  There still needs to be a little work done here to catch exceptions, but it is pretty functional.
