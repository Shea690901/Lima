<p><h1>Changes since Lima 1.0b1</h1></p>
<DL>
<DT><em>Sun Jul  2 09:00:32 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> updated help release<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul  2 22:08:05 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> modified compile() in LPSCRIPT_D so that it will not regenerate the tmp file if the tmp file is newer than the source file.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul  7 14:45:01 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made a change to SOCKET to utilize an updated socket_address() efun<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul  7 16:38:34 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added a local_address() function to SOCKET (That's harder to get than you might think and this way is better)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul  7 16:38:34 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made various modifications to FTP_D to remove resolve() calls that are no longer necessary with the recent SOCKET modifications<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jul  8 00:43:46 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed FTP_D to return an empty list when trying to ls <filename>/. rather than a 550 error.  The other way worked, but was not what is proper. (This still isn't perfect, but it's much much closer.  It's not an error now, but still gives an extra linefeed, which may be acceptable)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul 14 12:58:51 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed BODY (/std/body.c) to inherit /std/body/skills.c (subject to the define USE_SKILLS), removing comments and fixing a typo.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jul 15 12:18:58 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed M_ITEMS (/std/modules/m_items.c), changing "long" to "look" in line 43.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 18 09:49:03 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed a typo in M_EXIT on line 327.  query_method_destination should be query_method_description<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 18 10:14:55 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made a modification to M_EXIT to automatically append a \n to an exit description if it does not already have one.  (lines 341,342 added)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 18 10:24:53 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> modified the look verb so that you can now look at exits.  This means that exits can be described with set_exit_description(dir,desc) from the room.  (This function is smart enough to set the long of complex exits as well though not preferred and may change).  add_item()'s will still error if you add_item() an item with the same name as a simple exit(which shouldn't happen).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 23 09:53:34 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed the typo "bask" to "back" in /domains/std/Example_Room1.c<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 23 12:04:27 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> extended /include/combat_modules.h to handle FORMULA_STATS.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Jul 23 12:09:05 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> extended /std/adversary/mod_config.c to recognise FORMULA_STATS as a valid option.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Aug  2 14:16:01 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> (re)installed the colours command that works without the CONFIGURABLE_COLOUR define that was removed a /long/ time ago<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug  6 08:29:16 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed /domains/std/table.c, changing the inherit from COMPLEX_CONTAINER to CONTAINER and added a default relation of "on" (Thanks to Jonez for pointing this out).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug  6 12:34:30 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended PLAYER_MENU (/obj/mudlib/plmemu.c) to better handle prompting to change the ansi setting, by adding an intermediate function prompt_change_ansi() (problem and solution courtesy of Jonez).<p>
<DT><em>Sun Aug  6 13:39:12 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added some additional LPSCRIPT functionality to OBJECT>  Objects now retain their lpscript_attributes after first use so that they do not have to be recalculated every time an lpscript object is loaded.  A list of lpscript_attributes for a given object can also be acquired with list_lpscript_attributes().  A copy of the mapping is attained through dump_lpscript_attributes().<p>
<DT><em>Tue Aug  8 20:09:08 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> changed the north exit in /domains/std/cult/Foyer.c from ../room2 to ../Relations_And_Toys. Thanks to Marroc for pointing this out.<p>

<DT><em>Mon Sep  4 21:32:48 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added go down as an equivalent to descend and 'go up' as an equivalent to 'ascend' in METHOD_D<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 09:08:20 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added has_method() to M_COMPLEX_EXIT<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 09:09:10 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> rewrote STAIRS.  This may be a bit of a compat buster, but I don't think so.  It is no longer necessary for STAIRS to have arguments passed to it's crete/setup() in order for them to properly function.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 09:09:50 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed /std/object/names.c so that add_adjective will set a primary_adjective if one does not already exisdt.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 11:08:32 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added the verbs ascend and descend<p>
<DT><em>Thu Sep  7 19:28:41 2000</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DD> improved /obj/admtool/daemons/body.c, fixing the description of the 'r' option (remove limb) to distinguish it from 'R' (remove body), and added attacking to the valid limb types referred to in line 93 in set_limb_flags().<p>
<DT><em>Tue Sep 12 19:27:25 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a check for valid body type into add_limb_to_body() in BODY_D (/daemons/body_d.c).<p>

<DD> amended "/bulders/" to "/wiz/" in DOC_D (/daemons/doc_d.c). Thanks to Marroc for spotting it.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Sep 17 01:02:37 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> improved the messaging in do_diagnose_liv() in /cmds/verbs/diagnose.c, to avoid others in the room seeing full details - problem reported by Krant.<p>

<DT><em>Fri Sep 29 11:08:40 2000</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>
<DD> installed /std/accountant.c.  This solves the LPscript problem reported by Marroc.  This assumes adversary, so if you want one from living either modify this or make a similar object using living instead.<p>

<DD> fixed follow_hook() in M_FOLLOW (/std/modules/m_follow.c) to improve following, including support for function pointers and better checking.<p>

<DD> added a comment to imud_d.c about us-1.i3.intermud.org being the router address. would be nice if somebody could change imud_d.c to use a hostname rather than a bare IP<p>
<DT><em>Fri Oct 13 21:40:59 2000</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>

<DD> amended /obj/admtool/daemons/news.c to reflect the amendment above.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar  1 09:48:55 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended show_exits() in M_EXIT (/std/modules/m_exit.c), installing Marroc's fix to better handle case with all exits hidden.<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar  1 09:57:23 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added Marroc's proposed fix to /std/body/quests.c, returning 0 for check_quest() if there are no quests.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Mar  2 08:22:25 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added error-checking into can_drive_str() in /cmds/verbs/drive.c so that attempting to drive whilst not in a vehicle is better handled.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Mar  3 08:12:44 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended CORPSE (/std/corpse.c) to remove the $v from $vgnaw in the set_decay_action() in mudlib_setup().<p>
<DT><em>Mon Mar  5 08:31:06 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended direct_enter_obj() in /domains/std/objects/sand_castle.c to return a suitable failure message (moving the one from do_enter()).<p>
<DT><em>Tue Mar  6 19:01:26 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>

<DT><em>Sat Mar 10 10:28:46 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended rcv_finger_reply() in /daemons/imud/finger.c to convert int to string for those muds which choose to break the I3 protocol by returning level as int instead of string.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Mar 23 05:29:59 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed check_previous() in GUILD_D (/daemons/guild_d.c) to take the argument passed - thanks to Sarak for pointing it out.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Mar 25 14:58:49 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>

<DT><em>Tue Mar 27 08:05:31 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>

<DT><em>Thu Mar 29 15:03:02 2001</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>

<DT><em>Tue Apr 10 02:53:36 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>

<DD> tweaked HTTP_D so that it parses cgi a bit better with arguments (? vs ?=)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 05:51:51 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended make_unique_objects_if_needed() in CONTAINER (/std/container.c), adding a clonep() filter and adjusting the number by 1, which should ensure correct number of unique clones created on initial cloning.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 05:55:01 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed the default fill_action in M_FLUID_SOURCE (/std/modules/m_fluid_source.c), changing withdraw to $vwithdraw.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 05:58:49 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> amended M_READABLE (/std/modules/m_readable.c), adding set_entry_synonyms() as an alternative to set_synonyms() and adjusting the autodoc help appropriately.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 17 06:07:43 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> made fixes to M_FOLLOW (/std/modules/m_follow.c), changing autodoc name of set_follow_search() from set_follow_string, adding a did_move() into do_follow_obj() and improving arrive_hook().<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 23 02:54:55 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended /cmds/player/colours.c, removing the check for CONFIGURABLE_COLOUR (this was probably fixed before, but lost).<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 23 02:58:35 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added support for colours in admtool using the defined colours ADMTOOL_HEADING, ADMTOOL_HI and ADMTOOL_LO. Modified /obj/admtool/admtool2.c, /obj/admtool/internal/base.c slightly. The colours default to 'none'.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 24 00:38:03 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended ADVERSARY (/std/adversary.c), ARMOR (/std/armor.c), CONTAINER (/std/container.c), FLAME (/std/flame.c), FOLLOWING_MONSTER (/std/following_monster.c), FOOD (/std/food.c), KEY (/std/key.c), PAPER (/std/paper.c), SIGN (/std/sign.c), TORCH (/std/torch.c), WANDERING_MONSTER (/std/wandering_monster.c) and WEAPON (/std/weapon.c) -- Eliminating calls to ::lpscript_attributes() in inherited modules etc, as they are redundant; LPSCRIPT_D digs through all the inherits by itself.<p>
<DT><em>Thu May 10 14:19:49 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated M_SIBLING (/std/modules/m_sibling.c) to use a function instead of a string to refer to the sibling room path, removing the need for initialisation through on_clone().<p>
<DT><em>Thu May 10 14:20:07 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated DOOR (/std/door.c) to reflect the changes in M_SIBLING.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 04:03:02 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> added a 'destruct(ob)' into add_sell() in M_VENDOR (/std/modules/m_vendor.c) to remove items which are cloned as part of the sales process but neither used nor removed properly.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 05:56:38 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added the concept of a 'through' object in the movement system, that specifies the object through which you enter a room. This enables enter/leave msgs to make more sense, especially when one room has a "northern door" that you walk through, entering the next room through it's "southern door". Complex exit objects automatically set the 'through' object if they can find a sibling at the destination. Modified CLASS_MOVE (/std/classes/move.c), M_COMPLEX_EXIT (/std/modules/m_complex_exit.c) and M_SMARTMOVE (/std/modules/m_smartmove.c).<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 06:09:32 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> updated SECRET_DOOR (/std/secret_door.c), replacing call to get_default_exit() with query_default_error() so that it'll return the proper error message if trying to walk through the door without opening it (same message as if trying to walk in an invalid direction).<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 06:11:08 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> modified M_OPENABLE (/std/modules/m_openable.c), commenting out the code that changes adjectives of the object depending on open/closed state, as the new adjective seems to become primary, interfering with what you set in the object.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 07:52:59 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> added punctiation and a newline to the return message of door_check() in DOOR (/std/door.c)<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 11 08:12:09 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> modified /std/object/names.c, moving initialisation of primary_adj to resync(), where init. of primary_id is. Also modified set_id() and set_adj() to ensure the new ids/adjs end up in the beginning of the id/adj arrays, so that primary_id/adj resync properly.<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 13 16:19:06 2001</em>: <strong>Marroc</strong>
<DD> amended M_COMPLEX_EXIT (/std/modules/m_complex_exit.c), removing call to error() in complex_exit_direct_verb_rule() when rule format is unexpected. It now returns 0 now, as would seem more proper when the check cannot handle the rule.<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 13 16:47:50 2001</em>: <strong>Loriel</strong>
<DD> fixed part of the 'Pirate Quest', changing "player_left" to "person_left" in on_clone() in /domains/std/objects/ocean.c, and changing the matching in award_points() to if(evaluate(direction) == "the ocean") in the same file, and set the granting object to ocean instead of room.<p>
