<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 16:21:01 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> fixed hidden_door.c, so it should behave sanely now.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 16:28:14 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> fixed /std/monster/target.c:get_target() so combat now works in nested environments<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 16:30:48 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that /cmds/wiz/showexits.c now uses query_exit_desination()<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 21:03:44 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> updated /domains/std/Shop.c for the new exit code<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 21:30:18 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that /std/portal.c now uses the new exit code, and is probably different if you picked up the new exit code before the disk crash.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 23:03:18 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> modified m_exit_obj.c prep_default_msg(), set_default_destination(), and add_prep() so that default destinations, and preposition destinations get default enter/exit messages. NOTE: the default verb is "go" be sure you call set_go_method() in things that inherit from EXIT_OBJ.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 23:03:44 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added a set_go_method("enter") call to /std/portal.c<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  2 23:43:40 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> changed press -> do_press, and added a direct_press_obj: ok end block to /std/domains/std/2.4.5/obj/elevator_button.scr and elevator_call_button.scr<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 00:06:03 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> yanked useless can_pick_up_obj() and direct_pick_up_obj() functions from M_GETTABLE because "pick up OBJ" is a synonym for "get OBJ"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 00:16:42 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added do_go() to go.c which just calls do_go_obj(environment(this_body()), 0), as well as adding "go" with "leave" and "disembark" as its synonyms<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 00:21:12 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added "exit" as a synonym to the following rules in go.c: "go STR", "go", "go OBJ", and removed /cmds/verbs/exit.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 00:42:39 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that /cmds/verbs/stand.c now uses NVERB_OB, and ONLY supports the following rules: "stand" and "stand up" : "get up".<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 00:43:29 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> also notes that /cmds/verbs/go.c now also supports "stand" as a synonym for "go STR" and "go"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 00:57:34 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> removed "get off/on/in OBJ" from get.c and added "get" as a synonym to "go WRD OBJ", and "go WRD" in go.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 01:01:06 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes he added do_go_wrd(prep) to go.c to support the new rule: "go WRD" Things like: "get out" will now work if your environment supports the preposition "out".<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 01:12:20 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> removed "on OBJ" from /cmds/verbs/lie.c and added "lie" as a synonym for "go WRD OBJ" to /cmds/verbs/go.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 01:17:47 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> removed /cmds/verbs/dismount.c and added "dismount" as a synonym to: "go" and "go OBJ" in /cmds/verbs/go.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 01:26:58 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> removed "sit on OBJ", and "sit in OBJ" from /cmds/verbs/sit.c and added "sit" as a synonym to "go WRD OBJ" in /cmds/verbs/go.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 01:47:03 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> removed /cmds/verbs/board.c, and added "board" as a synonym to "go OBJ"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 02:01:26 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> updated the following verbs to use NVERB_OB: asnwer.c, ask.c, cast.c, count.c, curse.c, and dig.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 03:14:36 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added a can_go_wrd() to /cmds/verbs/go.c to make sure that the WRD is actually a preposition. "get WRD" was getting tried for "get:basket"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 03:28:14 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that drink, and drop now use NVERB_OB<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 03:45:27 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> removed /cmds/verbs/drive.c, and added the following rules/synonyms to go.c for "drive": "go STR", "go OBJ STR"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 21:32:41 1998</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added a function deep_useful_inv_parser_formatted which returns the deep useful inventory in the nested array format Rass says the parser prefers.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 22:56:53 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added an ineffecient workaround to the parser adding 2 versions of users to the parse hash to Rust's new simul. in /secure/simul_efun/objcalls.c<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb  3 23:16:48 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that the workaround is only partial, if you try: verb LIV and get a verb STR rule instead, do an "update here" This seems to get the parser back into the swing of things and adds users into the parser hash.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Feb  4 01:29:58 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> modified eval_dest() in M_EXIT to support returning object instead of just a string, and tweaked some RABUG()s in M_EXIT_OBJ not to cause a runtime error.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Feb  4 01:32:42 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> needed a place to stash whether this_body() was controlling a vehicle or not, and added /std/living/misc.c ALL exit checks that want to block vehicles should now do: this_body()->query_driving_vehicle(), you can retrieve the vehicle object via: this_body()->query_vehicle()<p>
<DT><em>Wed Feb  4 03:14:50 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that /std/vehicle.c, and /domains/std/camaro.c now work again.<p>
<DT><em>Wed Feb  4 16:29:55 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> rolled out the parser hack, we're better off having the parser see two Rassilons in the room then have "drop sword" not work correctly. /secure/simul_efun/objcalls.c<p>
<DT><em>Wed Feb  4 16:31:15 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added an ob_state() to /std/weapon.c that will cause different weapons to clump seperately, instead of all m_weildable's clumping together, on a suggestion from Monica.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 04:51:50 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added support for a room being in multiple areas, and for monsters to wander in multiple areas while still being backward compatible. Files: /std/base_room.c, /std/modules/m_wander.c THanks for the inital work Antillles<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 05:30:13 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's vendor changes, changed files: /cmds/verbs/ask.c, sell.c, /std/modules/m_vendor.c. new files: /cmds/verbs/buy.c, list.c. removed files: /cmds/players/buy.c, list.c. Very cool stuff!<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 05:33:15 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> copied vendor_changes to /help/wizard/coding<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 05:43:08 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> tweaked all all_inventory(environment(this_body())) calls in buy.c, sell.c, list.c into deep_useful_inv(parser_root_environment(this_body()))<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 05:51:40 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> altered parse_error_message() in /secure/master.c to take obj->query_plural() into account.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 05:54:04 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> altered plural_short() to take query_plural() into account in /std/object/names.c<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 05:58:15 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added direct_sell_obj() to /std/object/vsupport.c<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb  7 14:53:03 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> applied Monica's bugfix to m_vendor.c<p>
<DT><em>Sun Feb  8 19:52:36 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed ALIAS_D to require Mudlib:daemons instead of explicitly checking for the admtool<p>
<DT><em>Sun Feb  8 19:52:54 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> pointed <mudlib.h> to the proper place for ADMTOOL<p>
<DT><em>Sun Feb  8 19:53:20 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed alias.c in the admtool to request arguments for alias removal<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 18:21:33 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's money stuff, but its a work in progress, don't grab the stuff yet.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 18:24:01 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that the files effected are: /std/body/money.c, /std/accountant.c, /std/coins.c, /cmds/verbs/drop.c, /daemons/money_d.c, /daemons/account_d.c, /data/daemons/money.o, /domains/std/bank_accountant.c, /cmds/players/money.c<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 18:24:57 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes he forgot to mention /obj/admtool/daemons/currency.c, /std/modules/m_vendor.c, mudlib.h and daemons.h<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 19:13:33 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> simulated wiz_dir() for better functionality.  Also included w/ this change is another define in config.h  EXPANDED_WIZ_DIR, which for Lima by default will be undefined.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 19:13:51 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed admtool to use wiz_dir() instead of WIZ_DIR which won't work w/ EXPANDED_WIZ_DIR<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 19:14:09 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> notes that path.c was the file wiz_dir() was put in<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 20:41:55 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that /std/base_room.c, and /std/modules/m_wander.c have been changed to take into account that area is now always an array, and the prototype for set_area is: void set_area(string array area...)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 20:47:55 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> also notes that the wandering monster now tells you which direction it left. Wandering monsters can only leave through normal "go WRD" exits though.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 21:28:42 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added inside/outside checks to /std/vehicle.c so that you can't type: "get out of camaro" when you aren't even in it.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 21:29:38 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added sane exit preposition defaults to /std/furniture.c almost identical to vehicle.c<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb  9 22:01:09 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that /std/vehicle.c, and /std/furniture.c no longer inherit M_EXIT_OBJ, /std/non_room.c now inherits it for them. He also added a direct_go_obj() and direct_go_wrd_obj() overload to NON_ROOM so you can't e.g. (get on bed, get in car) any more without first "get off of bed"<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb 10 21:12:29 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes that he installed another Monica money drop, files: /std/accountant.c, /std/body/money.c, /cmds/verbs/drop.c, /cmds/player/money.c, /daemons/money_d.c, /data/daemons/money.o, /std/coins.c, /std/modules/m_vendor.c<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb 16 17:26:28 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed a new /std/accounant.c from Monica<p>
<DT><em>Thu Feb 19 02:31:48 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> modified /std/body.c to call drop_corpse() if DEATH_USES_CORPSES is defined, and moved the remove() from drop_corpse() in /std/monster/death.c to die() in the same file, fixing the fix Tigran failed to get right. :)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Feb 20 00:00:39 1998</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added a new snoop system that is more flexible than the old one. For info on files touched, etc... see news.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Feb 20 03:22:30 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> tweaked /cmds/verbs/go.c to only have one STR rule. can_go_str() now only gets called once, and thus the door's simple_action() in its set_exit_check() function only gets called once. This is still kinda funky as the user who typed the command will still see the parser chosen error message.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Feb 20 03:30:05 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> notes he added an example of set_enter_msg() to /domains/std/Wizroom.c<p>
<DT><em>Sat Feb 21 17:05:54 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> updated /std/body/cmd.c to include the environment root in the list of objects to the parser.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Feb 22 01:01:25 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> altered make_objects_if_needed() in /std/container.c to use absolute_path() instead of cannonical_form(), because absolute_path() uses both cannonical_form() AND handles ".." in file names<p>
<DT><em>Sun Feb 22 21:10:37 1998</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made an addition to snoop code, check news.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb 23 14:29:31 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's additions to /obj/mudlib/simple_ob.c. i.e. overrides of some of vsupport.c's direct_*_() functions<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb 23 14:33:59 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's additions to /std/container.c. It adds a set_unique_objects() api which allows you to only create an object if no other like it on the mud currently exists. Also includes support for allowing multiple versions of generic objects with a different unique id, see the source for more details.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb 23 16:05:04 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's fixes to /std/accountant.c fixes include: much cooler exchange rate list, and fix allowing somebody to deposit in other denominations of a currency besides the default one.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Feb 23 16:38:56 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> fixed the bug in /std/monster/target.c it called this_body() instead of this_object()<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb 24 17:12:56 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's update doc_d with some tweaks. New feature list: FIXME, and TODO's have source file and line # information now, FUNCTION blocks now try and find the functions prototype (does NOT find return types if it is on a seperate line from the function name), DOES NOT generate those obnoxious filenames like: xxxxxx(xxx because somebody has a //:FUNCTION xxxx(int x) kind of thing in the .c file, If it detects this, doc_d now logs it to /log/autodoc. Rock on Monica! :)<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb 24 17:46:50 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> installed Monica's small tweak to /std/accountant.c's exchange handling<p>
<DT><em>Tue Feb 24 18:40:09 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added a catch_up_newsgroup() to newsdata.c<p>
<DT><em>Thu Feb 26 00:21:21 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> fixed a typo in /std/door.c so that locked doors should now work.<p>
<DT><em>Sun Mar  1 07:50:22 1998</em>: <strong>Rassilon</strong>
<DD> added if (ob2 != 0 && environment(ob1) != ob2) return 0; to vsupport.c's:direct_get_obj_from_obj(); to prevent get OBS from OBJ from grabbing things in other containers. also added an indirect_get_objs_from_obj() to /std/conatainer.c logic works as follows: foreach(object ob in obs) { return error message if indirect_get_obj_from_obj(ob) fails; }<p>
<DT><em>Thu Mar  5 06:58:32 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed FTP_D so that it worked properly with ftp clients like efs and ange-ftp.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Mar  9 18:34:51 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added lock support into the modal system.  It now is possible to prevent ! escapes on a modal (/secure/user/inputsys.c)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Mar  9 18:35:25 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in /secure/user/sw_body.c in which the modal system was set up improperly if !<command> was used at the y/n prompt for taking over a body<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 15:54:48 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> implemented Monica's changes for move.c which includes autodoccing and a fix to give_new_obj() so it now accepts create() args<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 16:00:01 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> implemented Monica's bugfix to inf_supply.c to use create() args for give_new_obj()<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 16:11:12 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> implemented misc fixes to door code (door.c m_openable.c m_lockable.c and m_exit_obj.c) made by Monica<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 16:39:14 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> implemented more of Monica's money changes<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 16:40:44 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> makes a sidenote that files touched were /std/accountant.c /std/coins.c /help/wizard/currencies /obj/admtool/daemons/currency.c , in /cmds/verbs drop.c get.c give.c, /std/modules/m_vendor.c /std/money.c, and /daemons/money_d.c<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 17:05:39 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> notes additional files touched were /include/config.h /include/mudlib.h /std/container.c<p>
<DT><em>Wed Mar 11 19:33:10 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added another change to the money system by Monica (/std/body/money.c)<p>
<DT><em>Fri Mar 13 07:11:01 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added queueing to the newsreader.  Now when one does a regular listing (of just new articles) they are listed numerically.  Also added support to toggle threading, mark a newsgroup unread, and (Tigran thinks) fixed conversion from the old highwater method of saving read news to the new method.  Files touched /obj/mudlib/newsreader /secure/user/newsdata.c and/or /std/body/newsdata.c<p>
<DT><em>Fri Mar 13 07:12:41 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> modified /secure/user.c and /std/body.c to properly detect NEWS_DATA_IN_USER and accordingly inherit newsdata.c when they are supposed to<p>
<DT><em>Sat Mar 14 04:33:29 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> put the old newsreader back til he fixes the quirks he missed<p>
<DT><em>Sat Mar 14 18:22:32 1998</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Tue Mar 17 19:39:13 1998</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed go to (1) not allow nonsensical directions with objects, and (2) process exit_ob directions instead of room directions, when an object is explicitly specified<p>
<DT><em>Tue Mar 24 05:25:18 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DT><em>Fri Apr 17 06:54:30 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> added a rev_explode() sefun to misc.c which emulates REVERSABLE_EXPLODE_STRING as long as SANE_EXPLODE_STRING is defined in the driver (which the lima mudlib requires anyways)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 20 16:29:41 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made some improvements to the newsreader, hopefully it won't bug so much now<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 21 08:44:03 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> made a small modification to newsdata.c so that it saved after marking all articles in a group unread<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 21 19:29:31 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in M_SET that wasn't properly adding the , between parts<p>
<DT><em>Tue Apr 21 19:49:40 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> tweaked the article listing in news a bit for l and L.  If the article has been read a > is put in front of the line<p>
<DT><em>Sun Apr 26 06:48:42 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> installed a new M_WANDER.  There are compat busters involved with this new wander module, but it is much more flexable than the old one.  The old M_WANDER is now M_WANDER_OLD.  (files touched M_WANDER, M_WANDER_OLD (moved), /include/mudlib.c)<p>
<DT><em>Sun Apr 26 20:47:30 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DT><em>Sun Apr 26 20:53:57 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DT><em>Mon Apr 27 15:26:09 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug w/ news.  Used the wrong variable, sorry.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 27 16:58:12 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DT><em>Tue Jun 30 12:05:54 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>
<DD> added /daemons/attributes_d.c and changed /std/object/attributes.c to query it instead of the blueprint of itself.<p>

<DT><em>Tue Jul 14 08:11:38 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>
<DD> fixed edit_obj and ed_session so that they do not require a body.  Warning though, if the body does not exist, certain flags are not set to prevent multiple people being in the same file at the same time.  For instance, if the user w/out the body starts editing a file, someone else can regardless of body status.<p>
<DT><em>Tue Jul 14 11:59:40 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>
<DD> updated some verbs that got fucked up at the a7 release. Modified /std/modules/m_exit_obj.c, and from /cmds/verbs board.c, climb.c, dismount.c, drive.c, enter.c, exit.c, get.c, go.c, lie.c, sit.c, and stand.c. If any more need updating, post a report and I'll try to fix them.<p>

<DT><em>Thu Jul 16 07:54:54 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DD> fixed exec_code() so that _ is now an allowed character.  From within /daemons @.messages_d now returns the right file. (and this time i mean it)<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jul 18 10:10:32 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DD> fixed M_SMARTMOVE to remove a previous fix which I thought I'd already removed.  Upon update/reboot or whatever following should work here.<p>
<DT><em>Fri Jul 24 20:29:41 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>
<DD> removed /std/body/simple_level.c because it's never used anymore. Removed the option from config.h. This is configured from combat_modules.h now.<p>
<DT><em>Sat Jul 25 09:51:41 1998</em>: <strong>Tigran</strong>

<DT><em>Mon Jul 27 10:54:40 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>

<DT><em>Fri Jul 31 07:54:14 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>

<DT><em>Fri Jul 31 07:55:40 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>
<DD> added a second argument to /std/room/exits.c->query_exit_destination(). It's unused, but eliminates warnings.<p>

<DT><em>Tue Aug 11 13:54:39 1998</em>: <strong>Iizuka</strong>

<DD> modified ANSI_D->remove_default_colour() to map_delete() from the translations mapping as well. Thanks to Dunedain for pointing this out.<p>
