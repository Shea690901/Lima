<DT><em>Mon Apr  8 10:08:23 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed the error handling in master.c not to bail if the error context included a '%' (this essentially caused Satan's crasher, though I'm not sure why it crashed)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr  8 10:42:25 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> changed /daemons/news_d to pass this_user() as arg 1 when evaluating the restriction function; this means the standard restrictions are simple sefun pointers (to wizardp and adminp respectively).<p>

<DT><em>Wed Apr 10 06:39:13 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>

<DT><em>Thu May  2 16:41:09 1996</em>: <strong>Zakk</strong>

<DT><em>Tue May 14 01:18:36 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> felt like converting clone_object() to new(). So I did.<p>
<DT><em>Tue May 14 01:42:32 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> updated Zifnab's fix a bit more... he fixed the passing of varargs, but the 0 shouldn't have been necessary (it was an old hack). I'm removed the hack and cleaned up some associated code. Return to using new() as normal. Per Zif's change setup() (and now the mudlib_setup()/internal_setup() calls) get the varargs from the new() call.<p>
<DT><em>Wed May 15 05:31:38 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed direct_wield_obj() to return zero for objects in the inventory of other livings. It will work right as soon as the OBS fixes are in.<p>
<DT><em>Wed May 15 10:27:42 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug with leave being a synonym for exit, ( it bugged when you did a leave str), chagned the synonym to be only used for OBJ<p>

<DT><em>Wed May 15 12:40:09 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> realized that real name could be private as well, I3 fingers now return private for name as well<p>
<DT><em>Wed May 15 18:19:04 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in set_objects(), if you had an array of arguemts to be passed i.e. the door, and you wanted multiple doors the int as the first element of ththe array was being ignored<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 03:28:38 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added >, >>, < and |. Unfortunately, no commands use them yet... I'll start working on that.<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 04:46:13 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> remember a time when cpu returned usage of 0.3-0.5 .. now cpu is at 5-6 .. was it out by a factor of 100 (er 0.03-0.05) ..<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 04:47:57 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> mutters something about discovering what tsh did by testing it on dead.letter ....<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 07:08:36 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>

<DT><em>Mon May 20 07:28:43 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added a rehash command to the shell, which rehashes all dirs in your path. (No arg). AUTOMATIC_REHASH has left the building, it 's gone.<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 17:23:30 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> added a teeny hack to tide us over until I can really fix the underlying problem with command processing.<p>
<DT><em>Mon May 20 18:54:26 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> fixed all of the munging of spacing.  The only shell problem left, is that there needs to be a way to specify that a command doesn't want anything except backtick stuff to be processed.  I'll get to that one next time.<p>
<DT><em>Tue May 21 07:45:45 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug in say.c due to: if (!s<p>
<DT><em>Tue May 21 07:45:55 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Tue May 21 08:08:43 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Tue May 21 08:20:05 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>
<DD> votes that anyone doing"mudlist | pipe think" should be shot.<p>

<DT><em>Tue May 21 16:16:32 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added $* support to pipe when reading from stdin, so you can do things like: users | grep -v duuk | pipe"tell $* isn't Duuk a hoser?"<p>
<DT><em>Tue May 21 16:17:00 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> fixed I not to do redirection (lots of commands still need this, eg. tell, emote, etc)<p>
<DT><em>Tue May 21 16:34:31 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made all the player commands like tell, say, emote, etc... ignore piping stuff...  you can do this by adding: create(){::create();no_redirection();}<p>

<DD> renamed the pipe command to xargs ;-)<p>

<DT><em>Wed May 22 14:04:34 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>

<DT><em>Thu May 23 03:03:30 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made |<> work on channels, an oversight in not touching the chan command last night.<p>

<DD> tweaked M_GLOB to glob in alphabetical order, not reverse-alphabetical order<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 00:16:52 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> moved the print command outside the shell so it could use stdin and stdout.  Also means long eval results get mored, or can be redirected to a file, etc...<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 00:52:23 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> forgot to mention there's been a wc command for a few days.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 02:52:01 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made $ variable expansions disabled by default.  Do @.me->set_expand_vars(1) if you want to change this behaviour back to having foo expand ;-)<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 02:52:58 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> typoed: do @.me:shell->set_expand_vars(1) if you're cool ;-)<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 03:41:13 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>

<DT><em>Fri May 24 05:28:19 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added a head command, to show the front part of a file, and gave a -n option to it and to tail, which gives how many lines to show (default is 10 for both of them)<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 06:05:28 1996</em>: <strong>Zakk</strong>
<DD> put in a cut command. Much like your generic unix cut. the -d arg takes regex's.<p>
<DT><em>Fri May 24 22:27:34 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed mail to be nice and unspammy on first login<p>
<DT><em>Sat May 25 10:54:56 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Sat May 25 10:55:40 1996</em>: <strong>Beek</strong>

<DT><em>Sat May 25 20:25:55 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> added a findfile command that is a lot like linux' locate command.  Hopefully this will help new people find where in the lib a file is... if you know part of the name or path of a file, you can do: findfile blah.  findfile uses a cached database, which you can update w/ the -u flag if and only if you're an admin.<p>
<DT><em>Sat May 25 20:35:14 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed news to correctly list number of unread messages. No doubt there will be a faster way than my implimentation. :)<p>
<DT><em>Sat May 25 20:48:07 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made xargs take $$ as well as $* as a substitution token, JIC you want an alias that does an xargs (which I do want ;-)<p>
<DT><em>Sat May 25 20:52:42 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> fixed news to only display the number of messages that haven't been removed in initial totals ... makes it a little less intimidating for new readers :)<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 26 19:17:56 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> made spells use setup() and not create()<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 26 19:18:48 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> fixed the cast verb and the fireball spell, so cast fireball on zifnab works.  However, the combat result isn't prining the message Zifnab screams in pain!<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 26 19:38:52 1996</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> fixed a bug with kill_liv_with_obj<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 26 23:19:10 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>
<DD> think I came up w/ a reasonable formula for testing skills...<p>
<DT><em>Sun May 26 23:58:14 1996</em>: <strong>Rust</strong>

<DT><em>Tue May 28 01:04:34 1996</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
