<DT><em>Fri Jul 26 04:27:23 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> notes that SECRET_DOORs are not visible via "exits" or the exits display. (It's quite possible that some muds will want to use them for all doors <shrug>) As of now, they are automatically attached.<p>

<DT><em>Fri Aug  2 09:59:58 1996</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> added screen widths ... currently you need to use @this_user()->set_screen_width( whatever ) ... I strongly urge figures greater than 10 ( even 40 is pushing the useability) .. the "width" command will work as soon as I figure out why inp(1) returns 0 :P<p>
