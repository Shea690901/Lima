<DT><em>Fri Apr 18 20:39:53 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> notes that stairs and derivatives use relative paths of their _initial_environment_ (hence the stairs in the Wizroom take args of "Shop" and "Attic". having relative paths from /std/stairs is somewhat pointless :) [naturally one can use abs paths]<p>
<DT><em>Fri Apr 18 22:50:27 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>

Updated M_WEARABLE, M_WIELDABLE, M_LIGHTABLE, M_OPENABLE, and inv_list() in the sefun. Note that this fixes the synchronization bug w/ loading these obs and the relevant hooks.<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 21 02:18:48 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>
<DD> wanted to note that people that have objects with M_OPENABLE in their saved inventory will not load correctly because the "closed" variable is now missing. Just "su" after you fail to load :-)  (you may need to go to the wizroom, too)<p>
<DT><em>Mon Apr 21 23:48:29 1997</em>: <strong>Deathblade</strong>

<DT><em>Sun Apr 27 09:01:19 1997</em>: <strong>Ohara</strong>
<DD> notes that knock_knock in M_KNOCKABLE is not knock() [petty change, but alignment of object functions with verb names is a Good Thing (*TM) :]<p>

<DT><em>Wed Jun 11 13:05:41 1997</em>: <strong>Zifnab</strong>
<DD> added a check to beep for a shell var no_beep.  (set no_beep)  got sick and tired of being beeped today.<p>
