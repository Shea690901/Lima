===>  CODE DONATIONS
We accept code donations :-).  Several people have
contributed code so far that will be incorporated into
the next release of the lib.  If you have something that
you feel would make sense in the general release, then
feel free to upload it and send mail to "(admin)"

Any code donated will become "owned" by the Lima team,
insofar as you relenquish a say in its usage, distribution,
derived works, etc.

Your code WILL remain attributed to you, though.  We will
not "steal" the code.
