Every night, a daemon scans the mudlib for certain comments, and uses them
to build help files in /help/autodoc.  Comments which start in the first
column, and begin with //: are recognized as special (//### is an exception;
it is recognized too).  The following explains what the various types of
comments are, and what they do:

(1) //### This needs to be fixed ...

This adds a line to the file /help/autodoc/FIXME/module, where 'module' is
the last component of the filename the comment was found it.

(2) //:MODULE
    //This modules does ...

The comments after the first line will be put in the file
/help/autodoc/modules/module, where 'module' is the same as above.

(3) //:COMMAND
    //This command does ...

Same as //:MODULE, but /help/autodoc/command/ is used.

(4) //:HOOK foo
    //The "foo" hook ...

These are put in /help/autodoc/hook/foo.  A line is added specifying which
file calls this hook.  (E.g. "Called by /std/sword.c")

(5) //:FUNCTION foo <or> //:FUNC foo

These are put in /help/autodoc/functions/module/foo, where 'module' is the
same as above, and 'foo' is the name of the function being documented.

Misunderstood tags are writen to the log file specified as LOG_AUTODOC.
