Module ObjCalls:
These functions are available with the following lines of code:

#include <mudlib.h>
inherit M_OBJCALLS;


condense_phrase(arr) -- condenses a 3 element array of parser output:
({object, prep, object}) into a single object or group of objects.
Essentially reduces prepositional phrases, but not super-studly-smart.

nonsense() -- Sets the message the user is going to see on failure of
his action to something random along the lines of:  "What a concept!"

useless(action) -- Returns a string that randomly adds to the string
action something along the lines of: " is a waste of time".  Eg,
useless("beating the drum")  might return "beating the drum isn't
notably helpful."
