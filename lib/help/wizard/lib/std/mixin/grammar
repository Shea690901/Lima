Module Grammar:
These functions are available with the following lines of code:

#include <mudlib.h>
inherit M_GRAMMAR;


pluralize(s) --Creates a plural version of the noun s.  
Eg.  duck --> ducks.  Follows english grammar pretty well, and 
catches a lot of exceptions, but still isn't garunteed to always
give the right answer.

pluralize_verb(s) --A misnomer, this creates a singular version of
a verb if you pass it the plural.  
Eg:  People fight.  Fight is plural.  Pass it through
pluralize_verb() and you get "fights".  Not garunteed to be accurate.

punctuate(s) -- returns a string that is s, with a period added if the last
character of s is a letter.
