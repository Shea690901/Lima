You will be required to make your code portable.  To do this,
follow the examples in /gue/borphee/* for creating rooms, etc..
You will need to look at /gue/sys/borphee.h and create a simmilar file.

This is necessary so we can move your code to a central place when
it is completed... the path names to your objects, rooms and monsters
will only need to be changed in one central place, instead of all
over your directory
