How to document functions, commands and modules:


Documenting modules:

At the top of your module, before you start defining functions, but
after you've inherited everything you're going to inherit should go a
line like:

DOC_MODULE("This is the documentation for this module.  A module
should be any significant mudlib object, like a daemon, or anything in
/std.");



Documenting functions:

You should have a documentation string for every mudlib function that
isn't private.  Here's an example doc string for the function foobar:

DOC(foobar, "used as an example to show wizards how to document
stuff.");

void foobar(){

// function definition here....

}


Documenting commands:

At the top of your command, before you start defining functions, but
after you've inherited everything you're going to inherit should go a
line like:

DOC_COMMAND("the bobizz command doesn't do a thing.");
