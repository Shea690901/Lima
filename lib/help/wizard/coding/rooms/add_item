Items

 Simple Items 

Simple items should be things that were mentioned in your long description that are just there for decoration.  You can look at them, but anything else you try to do tothem will fail.  To make a simple item, call add_item () from your room's create () function (you can do this multiple times in a row):
   
    add_item ("dust", "There is a lot of it!");

If more than one down describe the same item, you can do this:

    add_item ("horse", "animal", "mare",
               "he doesn't look too interesting.")

 Other Items 

You can make slightly more interesting objects with add_item ().

You can give the object adjectives, and make it give error
messages back other than the default, "That doesn't make any
sense!" type of message.  For example, to make an old, faded
sign that you can't read, do the following:

    add_item ("sign", ([ "adjs" : ({ "old", "faded" }),
                         "read" : "The sign is too faded to read.",
                         "look" : "The sign is very faded.",
                         "get"  : "It would probably crumble to dust!",
                      ]) ); 

However, if you actually want to be able to read the sign, or get the sign,
you need to make an object for it.
