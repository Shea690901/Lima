USAGE:  shutdown  [-c]|[-t#] < str >

     This command will shut the mud down.  The -t flag will begin a delayed
shutdown.  The number immediately after the -t is the number of minutes the
delay should last.  While a shutdown is in progress, each minute the shutdown
daemon will warn all users.  The -c flag will cancel a timed shutdown.

For fun try the following:
   shutdown bite me
   shutdown asap
   shutdown now
