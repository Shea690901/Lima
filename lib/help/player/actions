		Communicating With Zork

Like the original Infocom games, Zork is able to understand a wide
range of user input, which is unlike most other MU*'s which normally
require very terse and specific commands.  However, Zorkmud is a
computer game, not an english professor.  Therefore, while it does
it's best to understand what you type, Zork does have it's limits.

The following examples should give you an idea of what is acceptable:

north
go north
go through the window
give the red barin to the old wizard
look through beek's crystal ball
get the red cake then drop it.  jump on it
drop the hat, the silver hammer, and all my zorkmids
trade all my stuff for a magic potato
get everything except for the gnarled broom
hello, sailor!
dwarf, tell me about babe flathead
ask the urchin about his jacket


Some points to keep in mind:

o Always use lower case letters for entering input.
o Use adjectives to distinguish between like objects, for example,
  if you see a red book and a green book, if you do not specify
  which you mean when talking about a book, Zork will assume for you,
  and as with all assumptions, may not always be right.
o Use a period or 'then' if you wish to execute more than one command
  in a single shot.  Do not use 'and' because it is treated as a comma
  in a list of objects:  'the hood, the bar and the twine'


If there is any input you think Zork should accept and does not,
please use the idea command.
