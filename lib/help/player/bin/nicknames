Help for nicknames:
The name command is used to give an object a nickname.  The syntax is:
name <object> <nickname>\n
From then on, the object may be refered to by its nickname.
Objects may share the same nickname, but this may cause some problems, depending
 on whether or not the two objects are in the room or on the mud at the same time.
Nicknames for most objects get lost every reboot, but nicknames for some
things, such as other players, will stick.  To get a list of your nicknames
 for others, use the 'nicknames' command.
