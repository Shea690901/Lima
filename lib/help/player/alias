Syntax for alias commands:

alias			View all aliases
alias -clear		Remove all personal aliases
alias <alias> <command> Set the verb <alias> to execute <command>
alias <alias>		check the value of <alias>
unalias <alias>		remove the alias specified.

Substitution variables that can exist in alias strings are:

$* - Will be replaces with your commands' argument
     upon expanding.  If you give no arguments, the defualt is called,
     which is usually a blank.  You can change the default
     value by placing it in {} immediatly after the $* the first
     time you use $* in the alias.  For example:
  	   >alias grin $*{like a psychopath}
  	   >grin
  	   You grin like a psychopath.
  	   >grin stupidly
  	   You grin stupidly.

Other substitution variables are not supported at this time.


Xverb aliases:
To create a one letter alias like ' for say, where you don't
have to type a space after the alias, do
append a $ to the front of the alias.  For example:
	alias $@ emote 
	>@smiles
	You emote: Rust smiles.
	>@ smiles.
	You emote: Rust smiles. (The space isn't needed but doesn't
				mess things up)
you need to use the $ in front to remove the
alias as well.  xverb aliases take precidence over a regular alias.

Alias expansion can be avoided by adding a \ to the front.
	for example:
	alias grin grin like a freak
	>grin
	You grin like a freak.
	>\grin
	You grin evilly.
