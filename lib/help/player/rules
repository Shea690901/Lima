 Following are the rules set up by the Administration of Zork MUD. You, as
 a player or visitor, to Zork MUD, are responsible for knowing and abiding
 by these rules.  They have been set up to make Zork MUD a more enjoyable
 playing experience for everyone involved.  Failure to do so can result in
 a number of punishments, to be detailed in related documents.
  
 Rule Book for Zork MUD:
------------------------
 * Second characters are permitted on Zork MUD, BUT, only under the following
    circumstances:
    + They must be played as separate, individual characters.  This means that
      the two characters may not be logged into the mud at the same time.
      A character who has gone "net-dead," or has lose link still counts as a
      logged in character.
    + The characters may not be switched with the intent to pass items or
      weatlh from one to the other.

 * Foul or abusive language is forbidden in any forms of communication,
    including, but not limited to, speech, emotes, tells, shouts, and notes.
 
 * Sexual harassment of any form.
 
 * "Flooding," or "spamming."  Flooding is the excessive use of return
    characters or text, output by a user with the intent of scrolling another
    user's screen to distract or annoy them.  The staff of Zork MUD may take
    exception to this rule in the use of ASCII graphics, spell design and its
    like, but may not abuse this power, and are subject to the same penalties
    as the whole of the Zork community.
 
 * The "Guest" character is for browsing of the game. Guest is not to be 
    used if a player already has a character created on Zork MUD. In the 
    rare case that a bug of some sort has prevented use of an existing 
    character, "Guest" may be used TEMPORARILY to inform a Wizard of the
    problem, at which time, actions will be taken to remedy the situation. 
    
 * Any and all bugs should be IMMEDIATELY reported to the staff of Zork 
    MUD, with the use of the "bug" command. Exploitation of bugs can make 
    the game less enjoyable for everyone, and can, in some cases, erase
    player files or crash the game.  On the other hand, good and honest
    reporting of bugs, ideas and typoes are much appreciated by the Staff
    of Zork Mud.
 
 * Link-death is illegal. Any use of link-death, such as to prevent death,
    or to prevent quitting, or any other clever and ingenious uses for it,
    is punishable as with all other rules established.
