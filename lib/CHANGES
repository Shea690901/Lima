Beek renamed Deathblade "deathblade_d" , and updated all occurances of in
    the lib. Also, Rust is now "m_rust" .

Ohara fixed a small bug in mail .. when you delete the last message, the
    count is now correct.

Beek fixed a few bugs in the hitpoint module, and generally cleaned up the
    interface a bit.

Beek fixed mudinfo to 'deal' with 0s in services lists, since the odds of
    TMI mudlibs being fixed in the near future is low.

Zifnab added verb support to give money to players, give amount type to foo

Beek #ifdef'd out some debugging code in M_WANDER

Beek added a 'codesay' command; try 'codesay void f(int x) { if (x) {
    return 1; } return 2; }' or something similar to try it out

Zifnab fixed teh help bug that allowed everyone to see all the help, i.e.
    wizards seeing admin help , and players seeing it all.

Beek fixed /include/ansi.h to use \e for escape instead of sprintf() [btw,
    is that file used any more?]

Deathblade installed v22a25 for the next reboot of the mud. It seemed to
    work fine with r11.

Zifnab fixed the bug of you seeing yourself on the bed complex_container,
    inventory_recurse(), avoid = ({ }) to avoid = ({ avoid }) approx line
    200

Ohara fixed kill to return something sensicle on kill STR since it wasn't
    doing it.

Deathblade installed Jihad's version of wrap(). It is arg-compatible with
    the old one: wrap(str, width, indent). iwrap(s) still exists and
    defaults to standard width wrap, indent of 4. The two uses of iwrap(s,
    n) have been changed to wrap(s, 0, n).

Deathblade simplified a bit of the spell casting code. Learning/prepping it
    for skills.

Deathblade added master::parser_error_message(). updated get/drop for OBS.
    updated vsupport, living, and verb_ob.

Deathblade updated the include files in /include/driver from the v22a25
    release.

Rust installed Onyx@Red Dragon's agressive module for monsters. it's
    M_AGGRESSIVE

Rust fixed the dreaded @ "foo.c" bug.

Beek fixed the error handling in master.c not to bail if the error context
    included a '%' (this essentially caused Satan's crasher, though I'm not
    sure why it crashed)

Beek changed /daemons/news_d to pass this_user() as arg 1 when evaluating
    the restriction function; this means the standard restrictions are
    simple sefun pointers (to wizardp and adminp respectively).

Ohara wrote ~ohara/status.c .... may not work on all terminals, needs
    current and max score hooked in, and needs work to fold it in (IE: when
    score changes, and when Eroom changes) (Hey .. this IS still GUElib
    right :)

Ohara hooked in the status line .. set status to see it .. having ansi on
    would help. Works for points, and light and dark rooms .. doesn't
    currently work for vehicles.

Ohara fixed /std/non-room.c so vehicles work with the status line

Ohara wrote sline which is a nice way of getting the status line on and off
    (Y'all sick of these reports yet? :)

Ohara shocking eh .. and on a piece of chrome, too :)

Ohara refixed up (surprise) the status line .. it's now in
    /cmds/verbs/look.c and /std/body.c (plus the points stuff..) Lemme know
    if there are wierd probs .. I fixed a couple to do with suing - there
    may be more.

Deathblade updated LOG_D to automatically add timestamps to certain subsets
    of the logs; currently just channel logging now. Other possibilities
    might include errors, quests, etc.

Zifnab fixed the groups command, can do group -a foo x x x , foo is group,
    x is players name. Also do groups -d foo to delete a group foo

Beek changed /std/less_sparse_obj to not go through create() if it isn't a
    clone; otherwise it ends up moving itself somewhere when loaded.

Zifnab fixed the v_plains bug. (with Rust's help)

Zifnab fixed less_sparse_obj.c (in the case of look at obj), it didnt
    inherit "/std/object/vsupport.c" , was missing a callback.

Zifnab fied snoop loggin when the snoop failed

Deathblade fixed the reception of emoteto packets. The \n was in the wrong
    place.

Rust fixed a problem w/ tell@frontier if frontier was an exact name, and
    there is another mud called frontiers

Ohara is fairly sure he fixed the sline one-line bug .. if not then it's as
    closed to squelched as it'll be till the client's done ;) <inhales ..
    VERY deeply>

Ohara is fairly sure he fixed the sline one-line bug .. if not then it's as
    squelched as it'll be till the client gets done ;) <inhales deeply>

Ohara fixed the s_line to work correctly when in a moving vehicle.

Zifnab borrowed beeks/jeearr doc on classes from ideaexchange and put it in
    /help/wizard/coding/classes

Deathblade updated the M_GRAMMAR module per Zifnab's notice that it had
    fallen out of date a bit.

Deathblade simplified the skill system. No levels, just points. No
    heirarchical storage of skills, but a simple map of skill to skill
    info. Nuked skills.h. Reworked (simplified) /std/body/skills.c and
    /daemons/skill_d.c. Add concept of training_points. More work to do on
    mgmt and actual use.

Zakk have more self respect than that

Rust was alright, for a while,

Rust could smile, for awhile.

Zakk changed force_look() from a #define to player->force_look(). (Knew I
    forgot to didlog something a while back, sorry about the delay.)

Beek fixed a bad prototype of remove_id in /std/object/visible

Beek removed an archaic prototype of print_result() from
    /std/living/state_of_mind and put a FIXME by an old style usage

Beek fixed /std/container to return "#You're in it!" so 'get all' ignores
    the room you are in.

Deathblade updated /daemons/imud/who.c to include the person's title rather
    than IP address in the returned data.

Deathblade wanted to point out that that idea was Satan's (so he says :-)

Deathblade installed Satan's version command (into /cmds/player)

Beek added the 'memusage' command; it will work as soon as we upgrade to or
    past v22a32.

Deathblade fixed the pluralization for words ending in 's'. They should
    have 'es' appended.

Beek added a 'sit at OBJ' rule, and made the sit verb pass the preposition
    used to the sit function

Zifnab fixed the bug with setup() not getting passed args to it. just a
    note, if you use new(file), pass it a second arg i.e. new(file,0) the 0
    will force setup() to be called

Deathblade felt like converting clone_object() to new(). So I did.

Deathblade updated Zifnab's fix a bit more... he fixed the passing of
    varargs, but the 0 shouldn't have been necessary (it was an old hack).
    I'm removed the hack and cleaned up some associated code. Return to
    using new() as normal. Per Zif's change setup() (and now the
    mudlib_setup()/internal_setup() calls) get the varargs from the new()
    call.

Beek fixed direct_wield_obj() to return zero for objects in the inventory
    of other livings. It will work right as soon as the OBS fixes are in.

Zifnab fixed a bug with leave being a synonym for exit, ( it bugged when
    you did a leave str), chagned the synonym to be only used for OBJ

Zifnab fixed I3 fingers to return (private) if the email is marked as such

Zifnab made /cmds/verbs/light.c return 0 for need_to_see(), can light all
    objects in the dark now

Zifnab realized that real name could be private as well, I3 fingers now
    return private for name as well

Zifnab fixed a bug in set_objects(), if you had an array of arguemts to be
    passed i.e. the door, and you wanted multiple doors the int as the
    first element of ththe array was being ignored

Rust added >, >>, < and |. Unfortunately, no commands use them yet... I'll
    start working on that.

Ohara remember a time when cpu returned usage of 0.3-0.5 .. now cpu is at
    5-6 .. was it out by a factor of 100 (er 0.03-0.05) ..

Ohara mutters something about discovering what tsh did by testing it on
    dead.letter ....

Rust made all commands use stdout when reasonable. stdout goes through
    more() by default. Nothing besides grep uses stdin yet...

Rust added a rehash command to the shell, which rehashes all dirs in your
    path. (No arg). AUTOMATIC_REHASH has left the building, it 's gone.

Deathblade added a teeny hack to tide us over until I can really fix the
    underlying problem with command processing.

Rust fixed all of the munging of spacing.  The only shell problem left, is
    that there needs to be a way to specify that a command doesn't want
    anything except backtick stuff to be processed.  I'll get to that one
    next time.

Beek fixed a bug in say.c due to: if (!s

Beek fixed a bug in say.c due to: if (!s \| s =="") { ...

Beek fixed pipe to read from stdin; this makes it work like UNIX xargs. 
    e.g."ls | pipe say"

Beek votes that anyone doing"mudlist | pipe think" should be shot.

Rust added a v flag to grep, and made a few more commands accept stdin

Rust added $* support to pipe when reading from stdin, so you can do things
    like: users

Rust added $* support to pipe when reading from stdin, so you can do things
    like: users | grep -v duuk | pipe"tell $* isn't Duuk a hoser?"

Rust fixed I not to do redirection (lots of commands still need this, eg.
    tell, emote, etc)

Rust made all the player commands like tell, say, emote, etc... ignore
    piping stuff...  you can do this by adding:
    create(){::create();no_redirection();}

Rust renamed the pipe command to xargs ;-)

Deathblade upgraded to v22a36. Let's see how well this works...

Zifnab added a few help files for rooms, set_exits, add_item, set_objects
    etc under /help/wizard/coding/rooms//*

Zifnab added a command to rebuild the help data, helpd for lack of a better
    name, anyone ff to rename it

Zifnab at beeks suggestion added an option to admtool to rebuild the help
    data

Deathblade rearranged some of the output of the 'stats' command to print
    out the guilds you belong to.

Deathblade started on a 'skills' command to print your skill information.

Zifnab added help for most of the modules.  There are still a few missing
    and they need a little bit of reformatting.

Rust made |<> work on channels, an oversight in not touching the chan
    command last night.

Rust fixed a stupid typo that caused spaces before a " to get snarfed

Rust updated pshell to call call_main() correctly in all cases WRT recent
    changes

Rust made ROOM point back to indoor_room, and removed /std/room/room

Rust upgraded us to a38, which fixes the mudlib error handler problem (thx
    Beek!)

Rust fixed shell builtin commands to implode properly

Rust fixed all the commands from the player menu

Rust tweaked M_GLOB to glob in alphabetical order, not reverse-alphabetical
    order

Rust moved the print command outside the shell so it could use stdin and
    stdout.  Also means long eval results get mored, or can be redirected
    to a file, etc...

Rust forgot to mention there's been a wc command for a few days.

Rust made $ variable expansions disabled by default.  Do
    @.me->set_expand_vars(1) if you want to change this behaviour back to
    having foo expand ;-)

Rust typoed: do @.me:shell->set_expand_vars(1) if you're cool ;-)

Rust changed map_paths not to reverse the order of files, now ls looks
    right again

Rust added a head command, to show the front part of a file, and gave a -n
    option to it and to tail, which gives how many lines to show (default
    is 10 for both of them)

Zakk put in a cut command. Much like your generic unix cut. the -d arg
    takes regex's.

Ohara fixed mail to be nice and unspammy on first login

Beek removed the destruct_env_of() master apply; it was obsoleted back in
    v20.22 ...

Beek implemented a proper move_or_destruct() subroutine in /std/body.c;
    it's also more robust than the old one

Rust fixed xargs to accept multiple words properly

Rust added a findfile command that is a lot like linux' locate command. 
    Hopefully this will help new people find where in the lib a file is...
    if you know part of the name or path of a file, you can do: findfile
    blah.  findfile uses a cached database, which you can update w/ the -u
    flag if and only if you're an admin.

Ohara fixed news to correctly list number of unread messages. No doubt
    there will be a faster way than my implimentation. :)

Rust made xargs take $$ as well as $* as a substitution token, JIC you want
    an alias that does an xargs (which I do want ;-)

Ohara fixed news to only display the number of messages that haven't been
    removed in initial totals ... makes it a little less intimidating for
    new readers :)

Rust made spells use setup() and not create()

Rust fixed the cast verb and the fireball spell, so cast fireball on zifnab
    works.  However, the combat result isn't prining the message Zifnab
    screams in pain!

Zifnab fixed a bug with kill_liv_with_obj

Rust think I came up w/ a reasonable formula for testing skills...

Rust added to M_LOCKABLE code to handle magic openings, and picking,
    including code to test skills if USE_SKILLS is defined.  This is part
    of a first jab at a skill...

Rust added a pick verb.

Deathblade updated us to v22a39
