Beek added 'treefor' for driver types. Very similar to codefor. 

Zifnab redid the objects and room doc any suggestions, comments, or flames 
    greatluy appreciated 

Beek removed the M_GRAMMAR inherit from M_MESSAGES by substituting a 
    prototype for punctuate() 

Beek removed a M_GRAMMAR inherit from /std/player.c; it gets it via living. 

Beek added a quick fix to /std/modules/grammar to keep pluralize from 
    bailing when strlen(str) < 2 

Rust added plans for anyone, w/ Yaynu's help 

Rust modified the home pages to be consistant w/ the current release, and 
    set it up so that emacs' html-helper mode will automatically time-stamp 
    the files properly. However, I couldn't write them back to the write 
    place, so they're in ~lima/public_html. 

Deathblade fixed mv. cleaned up the source, too. 

Deathblade fixed cp, too. Cleaned up its code, too... sigh 

Beek made Harry blush when you kiss him. 

Beek fixed a few bugs in treefor (efun handling). 

Deathblade upgraded to v21.7a4 and tweaked a few files that had compilation 
    problems (read: bad prototypes). I reorg'd the code and removed the 
    prototypes (who needs 'em?). 

Deathblade added a small section to the Lima Web FAQ: why so many emotes? 
    Comes complete with a chart :-) 

Beek added support for regexps in didlog. Try didlog <pattern> <optional 
    number of days> 

Rust changed didlog so it uses glob-style patterns instead of regexps. 

Beek added support for multi-targetted emotes. 

Beek added rumble LIV LIV and karate LIV LIV; definately worth trying out 
    :) 

Beek noticed BeekMUD only has 420 emotes. Time to upgrade ... 

Beek added the nounverb3 emote, showing how useful WRD can be :) 

Beek added a verbs command for wizards 

Rust changed the mixin help dir to modules. 

Deathblade upgraded us to 7a5 to fix this and that... 

Deathblade shorted the MOTD by moving a couple items to help topics. Feel 
    free to review/edit/comment. new topics: release, donate 

Beek changed soul_d to not try to do * expansion on the 'real names' 
    portion of the arg list. 

Deathblade switched us to 7a6. 

Deathblade completed an initial imp of user_d.c with some test vars. will 
    be used in finger_d and a couple other cmds. 

Beek changed profile <no args> to print the top ten programs. 

Deathblade tweaked the mudlib's override of pluralize() to fix a case for a 
    particular emote that was added today. 

Deathblade added emote "666" as the 666th Lima Mudlib emote. :-) 

Deathblade updated USER_D some more: added new vars, changed API a bit, 
    commented, pre-flighted priv checks 

Deathblade fixed FINGER_D to report information via USER_D and the mailbox 
    APIs (added a new func to the mbox, too). Finger now works really well. 

Beek changed get_item_desc() to evaluate() the value and return the result 

Beek added a format_string() simul to the strings simuls for doing "x, y, 
    and z" and "x, y, or z" 

Beek changed format_string to format_list to correct a brain-o. 

Deathblade cleaned up the mail system to use "correct" data flow. mailbox, 
    mail_d, classes/mail_msg, and the mailers 

Deathblade fixed it so that admins cannot be forced. 

Beek fixed the message module to allow (1) an arbitrary number of objects 
    and actors, (2) correct pronouns no matter how many of them are 
    aliased, and (3) improved reflexive support. 

Beek fixed the message module to do reflexification correctly. See the news 
    post for details. 

Beek added a missing #ifdef USE_STATS around the call to 
    bodystats::create() 

Beek fixed the bug (in /std/shell) that would give you an error if your 
    command consisted entirely of spaces. 

Rust added yaynu's ansi command in 

Rust left the Zork people a gift on ZorkMUD. See if you can find the gift. 

Yaynu added ansi controls to player menu. 

Beek fixed barney; he was using $o $o2 instead of $o $o1 

Zifnab fixed a small bug in /cmds/wiz/home.c that wouldnt let you do home 
    ohara 

Zifnab added yaynus ansi option to the personal information of the menu 

Zifnab also added mudinfo to the wizard menu 

Beek fixed a bug in $Ts handling. 

Beek changed && usage in addemote slightly; 'x' and 'x && y' work the same 
    as they used to, but you can now do: 'foryou && forothers && fortarget1 
    [&& fortarget2 ...]' 

Beek fixed a bug that would cause errors in the default rule of some 
    targetted emotes. 

Rust moved all the stuff that doesn't load in /std to /std/broken by 
    Calin's request. 

Ohara added a small present for the Zorkmud folks over on zorkmud too, even 
    more obscure than Rusts is (What the Hell IS it, rust ... ;) 

Rust wanted Ohara to know it's the old login screen, duh =) 

Beek fixed the verbs command to filter out emotes based on individual rules 

Beek made log_error() in the master private 

Beek changed log_error() back :-) 

Beek fooled with the formatting of compilation errors a bit; it now prints 
    out the src line. Comments appreciated on the format. 

Beek fixed /std/shadow.c and moved it back to /std 

Beek fixed the error reporting to handle tabs correctly 

Beek fixed the handling of long lines and multiple instances of the context 
    in the error code 

Beek reformatted the errors yet again :-) 

Zifnab added a -f flag to people to show the file name, defaults to the 
    short of the room 

Zifnab hace finished documenting the wiz commands, it is very rough and 
    needs some cleaning up but the cmds are there :) 

Zifnab need to clarify that the cmds in /cmds/wiz 

Beek removed get_fakeobj() and parse_item_desc() from items.c 

Beek made direct_get_obj() in /std/object/vsupport.c check for fake items. 

Beek moved direct_get_obj()'s handling of containment to container.c and 
    out of vsupport; it was duplicated for the most part 

Beek fixed living.c to say He/She/It is carrying 

Beek fixed the safe typo 

Rust fixed the people bug 

Beek added a check for "open" by itself in /trans/ob/telnet_ob 

Beek fixed the 'exits' doc to not use Amylaar style closure syntax 

Beek removed the player 'exits' command, as it was added over a year ago 
    because there were no room descriptions on the example area on Zork at 
    the time; obviously distribution libs don't need such a command, as it 
    would show hidden exits, etc. 

Beek added the 'showtree' command for figuring out inheritance trees. 

Beek added a way to find out all the instances of a function in an 
    inheritance tree; try: showtree the_short /std/player.c 

Beek changed the soul_d so that if a verb has a "WRD" rule, the word MUST 
    be and adverb; this allows such rules to not conflict with existing 
    game verbs of the same name 

Beek removed the valid_object() in master, since DOC_D no longer needs it 

Beek rewrote the doc_d; it's pretty simple now; comments are welcome. Right 
    now it does the sweep after the mud has been up 24 hrs (and every 
    following 24 hours) 

Beek made it so that all lines that begin with //### get logged to 
    /help/autodoc/FIXME 

Beek updated most of the mudlib to use the new doc syntax 

Beek fixed a bug that would cause two messages to be delivered if you were 
    both targets of a doubly targetted emote 

Beek documented the functions in M_MESSAGES 

Beek added a hook module; see /std/object/hooks.c 

Beek fixed some incorrect handling of extra_short() in inv_list() 

Beek changed remove_hook() to remove_me() in WEARABLE; the former conflicts 
    with the hooks module 

Beek used the hook module to actually solve the extra_short() problem in an 
    elegant way ... 

Beek made extra_long() use hooks as well 

Beek changed prevent_get()/prevent_drop() to be done using hooks 

Beek made remove call the remove hooks, which means M_ACTIONS doesn't need 
    a remove() function 

Beek made prevent_open and prevent_lock into hooks 

Beek made locked and key_type private in M_LOCKABLE 

Beek moved some of Zif's safe code to M_LOCKABLE 

Beek made some more modifications to M_LOCKABLE to make it interact better 
    with the parser, and handle (with key) assumptions correctly 

Beek added a wish verb 

Beek fixed a bunch of instances of _word_ instead of _wrd_ J found 

Beek fixed inv_list()/short() to be more consistent about when to print 
    extra_short()'s [now only printed in inv_list()s] 

Beek fixed the wear verb to work again 

Deathblade cleaned up /secure/user: moved more body handling into sw_body. 
    moved plan stuff to the body. moved password handling into login.c. 
    removed set(). removed title. 

Beek changed extra_open()/extra_close() to the "open" and "close" hooks 

Beek made <mudlib.h> get included from <global.h> 

Beek added a M_SWITCHABLE module 

Beek added M_LIGHTABLE 

Beek suggest we upgraded to get around the parser crasher that keeps 
    hitting us ... 

Beek added /domains/std/lantern.c as an example of how to use LIGHTABLE and 
    SWITCHABLE together 

Beek fixed the hooks module to handled owner-dested fp's correctly 

Beek added a "move" hookpoint when objects move 

Beek made it so that call_hooks() can take arguments 

Beek added //:HOOK to autodoc 

Beek documented the lfuns in /std/container.c 

Beek documented a number of objects in /std 

Deathblade tweaked profile to not wrap a string 

Deathblade added dump_to_file() to the NEWS_D. Will use it this week to 
    clear out bugs. 

Beek removed the call to evaluate_path() from valid_write(); the driver 
    sends absolute paths and it's rather expensive 

Beek put it back after thinking a bit more 

Beek rewrote and optimized evaluate_path 

Beek cleaned up some stuff in more_ob, including some sscanf()'s that could 
    be replaced by indexing. Also fixed the adjacent %s%s bug. One notable 
    change; searches in more are now regexps, not substrings 

Beek made set_brief()/set_proper_name() handle function pointers 

Deathblade removed the "emotions" alias for "feelings" . Use the real 
    command or make a personal alias. 

Deathblade removed the wiz "type" command, too. Use "which" if you want 
    that functionality or make a personal alias. 

Deathblade want to note that I removed the wiz "type" _alias_, not command. 

Deathblade fixed a bug with punctuate( "  " ) 

Deathblade updated rules and code for some various commands: echoall, 
    parse, spew, shutdown, pipe 

Deathblade updated help for channels 

Deathblade changed the newsreader to use a more compact message line format 
    in many cases. 

Deathblade made /secure/modules/login::set_password non-private so you can 
    actually use "passwd" to change it :-) 

Deathblade removed a gazillion lima.bugs posts. 

Deathblade fixed a small bug in the "emote" command w/o an arg. 

Deathblade incorporated Ranma's logging of logins/outs 

Deathblade folded in Ranma's logging of force cmds 

Rust reworked the banish code a bit... It'll log a reason if you provide 
    one. Site banishing works. it's now banish -n name [reason] or banish 
    -s site [reason] or just banish to show current banishes. They both 
    accept unix style wildcards. (cont) 

Rust : The IP # must make a full match, but the name can partial match. Eg, 
    banish -s *virginia* will banish everyone from any site w/ a virginia 
    it, but only banish -n virginia is necessary to banish all names w/ 
    virginia as a substring. 

Rust made it so you can only use lower case letters or a dash in a new name 
    by banishing [^a-z-] 

Beek noted that banishing *virginia* is a bad idea anyway, since it will 
    quit working when the address server goes down; you're better off 
    banishing ip numbers 

Deathblade streamlined and incorporated Ranma's path commands: addpath, 
    rmpath, showpath. Ranma wrote help for these, too, which has been 
    installed. 

Deathblade tweaked doc_d to create the doc is the last_time == 0
