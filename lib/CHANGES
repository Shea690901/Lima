Tigran made a quick hack to more easily allow for multiple login screens.  See config.h for more info.  Files touched config.h login.c

Iizuka removed 'int indrect_get_obs_from_obj()' from /std/container.c. Bog. <?>

Iizuka fixed query_primary_adj() in object/names.c to return primary_adj instead of primary_id. Thanks to Dunedain for pointing it out.

Iizuka renamed remove() in /std/modules/m_wearable.c as remove_it().

Iizuka updated /std/armor.c.

Iizuka hacked /std/adversary/death/vaporize.c so that worn objects get dropped correctly when the adversary dies.

Iizuka overloaded ob_state() in /std/armor.c to remove a warning.

Iizuka removed /cmds/player/rep.c. The data it reports is not used anymore at all.

Iizuka changed /domains/std/objects/backpack.c to call m_wearable::remove_it() instead of remove(). Thanks, Antilles.

Tigran tweeked MOVING_MONSTER so that it includes M_ACTIONS, which it should have previously.  Also, M_ACTIONS was removed from FOLLOWING_MONSTER

Tigran made a tweak to M_WANDER, updating query_exit_value() to query_exit_destination().

Tigran fixed help to use more() instead of it's own internal more.  He was sick of it not having some of the functinoality that more() did.

Tigran notes that the file touched was /obj/mudlib/helpsys.c

Iizuka updated the autodocs in /std/adversary/behaviors.c. Some of the comments and docs were left over from the old monster.c.

Iizuka changed die() in body.c to protected.

Iizuka updated autodocs in /std/adversary.c and all adversary/armor modules.

Iizuka made die() protected in both adversary/death modules and autodoc'd a couple things.

Iizuka removed the die() autodocs from /std/body.c.

Iizuka updated autodocs in health/hit_points.c and health/limbs.c. The other modules don't really need autodocs.

Iizuka changed set_lit() in LIGHT_OBJECT, M_LIGHT_SOURCE, and M_LIGHTABLE to be protected.

Iizuka changed line 39 of /cmds/wiz/iftp.c to call lower_case(arg) instead of lower_case(mudname), as Dunedain reported. However, iftp appears still not to work correctly.

Iizuka added an error check as suggested by Loriel into will_fit() for M_FLUID_CONTAINER and re-formatted the file so it's at least readable.

Tigran fixed the cat command to work properly.  The stringlimit now doesn't effect it.

Iizuka changed diagnose_msg() in /std/adversary/health/wounds.c to use a class (diagnosis) instead of a mapping.

Beek fixed renew to work with LPscript objects

Iizuka changed lines 219, 221, and 252 of wounds.c to return "$P" instead of "Your" in the string.

Rassilon changed this_body() to this_object() in force_look in M_SMARTMOVE so that force_look() will work for NPCs.

Tigran made a tweak to object.c that at least gives clean_up an opportunity to destruct objects when it is called.

Tigran updated /std/object/properties so that the variables initialized properly and thus create() wasn't needed anymore.  This also required a tweak to OBJ to remove the properties::create() call

Tigran notes that query_perm_sets() function was also added to properties.c for consistancy

Iizuka fixed /domains/std/magic_torch.c to work with unlimited fuel again. Removed the call to set_fuel() and overloaded check_fuel() to always return 1. It used to call set_fuel(-1). That doesn't work anymore.

Iizuka fixed Dunedain's "every day is my birthday" bug in BIRTHDAY_D. What a fool for reporting that one!

Iizuka installed Dunedain's tell history code. Modified files are /cmds/player/tell.c, /daemons/imud/tell.c, and /daemons/imud/emoteto.c.

Iizuka installed Dunedain's patched /trans/cmds/findfile.c. Fixes some annoying bugs with endless loops.

Iizuka fixed /domains/std/Monster_Room.c not to bug out the GUILD_D when you go north.

Iizuka added Dunedain's patch to /cmds/wiz/review.c that fixes some bugs in displaying fol_leave or fol_enter messages.

Iizuka fixed query_history() in /cmds/player/tell.c to check before imploding.

Tigran modified showtree so that it will take an object as an argument in addition to a filename.  Don't see any reason to keep findfunc anymore.

Tigran ammends, /cmds/wiz/Cmd_rules needed to be fixed so that showtree's new functionality would work right.

Iizuka added lpscript_attributes() to M_WEARABLE, updated ARMOR with respect, then updated /domains/lpscript/chainmail.scr to work.

Iizuka changed all instances of is_player() to query_link() in M_WANDER.

Tigran finally got http_d so that it handles images properly.  It is amazing what happens when you actually send it.  HTTP_D is still a work in progress though.

Tigran made a slight tweek to NEWS_D to make it use a chaching variable that it wasn't previously.

Tigran installed an optimization to the newsreader.  It should be /immensely/ faster now.  There are possibly still a couple of areas where it's performance can be improved however.

Tigran upgraded the driver to 22.2a26

Tigran added local_port_address() to SOCKET so that we can actually figure out what port a socket is listening on when using 0 for the listen port

Tigran added passive file transfers to FTP_D.  This should reduce some of the errors that we get from it.  More work needs to be done now to detect whether a port is connected or not when /not/ in passive mode

Tigran tweaked FTP_D again.  The read callback wasn't fucntioning properly and files would be stored with 0 bytes....no longer a problem.

Iizuka changed line 48 of /trans/cmds/cat.c to 101 rather than 100. Dunedain claims this fixes something. =)

Iizuka fixed /obj/mudlib/plmenu.c to display adverbs and souls correctly.

Iizuka changed the "" rule in stand so that it actually works. "stand WRD" needs to be redone.

Iizuka changed the stand verb again. "stand WRD" is removed, "stand up" is added. Correct messages are displayed now if you try to stand when you're already standing.

Tigran am backgrading the driver to 22.2a21 because a26 crashes too much

Iizuka removed /std/body/simple_exp.c - We don't use it anymore. Write a module for /std/adversary/advancement/ instead.

Tigran installed thread caching into NEWS_D.  This should make the newsreader a /lot/ faster (it was modified some too).  NEWS_D takes longer to load now, so don't update it without a reason.

Tigran made a fix to ADVERSARY, given by Antilles.  It now passes arguments to create in LIVING properly

Tigran added a fix to NEWS_D so that it won't eval_out when starting up initially (I think that's the problem anyway)

Tigran fixed a typo on NEWS_D reported by DuneDain

Iizuka changed $vare to $v1are in "dam3" in messages_d.c.

Iizuka fixed /cmds/verbs/wield.c not to runtime when players try to 'wield sword in right arm' when WIELD_SIMPLE is defined.

Iizuka added a simple implementation of attack speed to adversary. Modified files are /include/combat_modules.h, /std/adversary.c, /std/adversary/main.c, and /std/adversary/formula/simple.c.

Iizuka made attack_speed default to 1.

Tigran wrote METHOD_D, which will be handling synonyms for various go methods (though it may have other applications too).  The functions are fully autodoc'd  (files touched <daemon.h> and METHOD_D

Tigran updated METHOD_D to be more discriminating on methods added

Tigran made a fix to FTP_D.  HOpefully this will reduce the error count.

Tigran updated METHOD_D to clean_array() synonyms.  No sense in having duplicates

Tigran fixed a couple of typos in METHOD_D and made add_method() check for whether the method already existed before adding it again

Tigran added add_relations/remove_relations() to COMPLEX_CONTAINER

Iizuka added set_real_name() to /secure/user/userinfo.c and modified /obj/mudlib/plmenu.c to allow users to change their real names after login.

Beek fixed a few attempts to create targetted messages using {simple,my}_action in resurrect.c

Iizuka changed /secure/user/userinfo.c so that all checks if(this_body() != query_body()) to if(this_user() != this_object())

Beek added code to catch 'drop 0 coins'

Iizuka added a quick little hack to enter_game() in /std/body.c so that on wound-based systems, healing would restart correctly upon login. Thanks to Ajnabi for pointing this bug out.

Rassilon removed /cmds/wiz/findfunc.c because showtree has identical functionallity and its just so much cooler. example syntax: "showtree query_formatted_desc me"

Tigran updated M_MESSAGES to make better utilization of MESSAGES_D.  Default messages will now poll MESSAGES_D rather than first storing them ni the body.

Tigran added a clean message to default-living messages of MESSAGE_D

Beek added a 'admin-channels' domain

Rassilon fixed VERB_D so it doesn't stop loading verbs anymore if one of the verbs fail to compile, it now just does its best to keep on chugging.

Rassilon tweaked M_MESSAGES to now have targeted_action delegate to the mispelled but old favorite targetted_action.

Rassilon commented out some RABUGs in /std/door.c

Rassilon tweaked /std/object/vsupport.c::direct_get_obj_out_of_obj to call direct_get_obj_from_obj to perform some addtional consitency checks before calling direct_get_obj.

Rassilon tweaked /daemons/channel/moderation.c to fix the bug Lighting reported about trimming spaces at the wrong spot in the argument.

Iizuka changed remove_it() to remove() in m_wearable and armor.

Rassilon made Iizuka copy /include/light.h into place. It contains FUEL_DELAY (# of seconds between decays of the fuel source) and INF_FUEL. If you pass INF_FUEL into set_fuel() you can create a light_object that flickers forever. Modified /std/light_object.c to yank FUEL_DECAY

Rassilon fixed /domains/std/objects/backpack.c to call m_wearable::remove() instead of remove_it()

Iizuka changed all instances of pointerp() to arrayp() throughout the lib.

Rassilon special cased "hum" -> "hums" in M_GRAMMAR since pluralize translated it into "ha"

Rassilon added some helpful instructions for multiple message rules to addemote.c

Iizuka added weaknesses to armor code. Modifications to /std/modules/m_damage_sink.c by myself and Rodney@Timescapes.

Iizuka added abs() absolute value function to /secure/simul_efun/misc.c.

Tigran made a fix to reply.  If you hadn't received a tell and tried to reply, it errored.

Tigran banished *.hawaii.rr.com

Tigran added NEWS_D to preload so that the newsreader doesn't crap out when the first person invokes it.

Tigran fixed find_body() so that find_body(0) won't resolve to the first person it finds with no nickname.

Iizuka fixed /domains/std/Monster_Room to send ({ "sorcery" }) rather than "sorcery" as an arg to guild_guard.

Zakk won't even start until I have the cash

Zakk would like to point out Moonie is no longer using Lima

Tigran fixed FTP_D to allow NLST to take flags.  I do not believe that this meets the RFC requirements (they should be using LIST if they are passing flags), but some clients appear to be doing this anyway, nto the least of which is the crappy ftp client that comes with MS Windows

Tigran notes that all files which are being replaced are being saved as <file>.pre_conv instead of <file>.c

Tigran completed the exits update so far as I can recall from my changelog.  If there's any parts missing I'll get them imp'd and didloged separately

Tigran removed all calls of query_prone() from /std/body/naming.c

Tigran installed COMPLEX_EXIT_OBJ.  <mudlib.h> has the added define for this and the EXIT_OBJ define now also points at the new exit object.

Tigran fixed a typo in M_EXIT's autodoc for query_default error

Tigran removed /trans/cmds/dbxtracer.c  It is something which appears to be /very/ out of date.  In fact it used shadows which are turned off in compilation.  The shadow that it was trying to use (and is really the purpose of the command) doesn't exist.

Tigran fixed some things that were wrong with vehicles.c and replaced /domains/std/camaro.c with a version that will work with the new vehicle.c and containers and exits.

Tigran moved /domains/std/chest.c to /std/chest.c and added an entry for CHEST in mudlib.h.

Tigran fixed CHEST to handle new container code

Tigran wrote a new /domain/std/chest.c utilizing the new CHEST inheritable.  I also trimmed down the inheritable so that it does only what it needs to.

Iizuka added set_relations("in") to /domains/std/chest.c.

Iizuka added set_relations("in", "on") to /domains/std/dish.c.

Iizuka added /std/adversary/state_of_mind.c. It's undecided whether this will remain in adversary or go back to living, but in the mean time it does fix combat.

Iizuka changed /std/combat_spell.c so that it correctly considers damage types when adding a new combat event.

Tigran fixed CHEST and /domains/std/chest.c properly so that they have default relations set.

Tigran fixed M_SMARTMOVE in the manner suggested by Loriel.  This is not a total fix I don't think as there is still the issue of the rest of the message looking wierd.  This may be desirable or may not, but currently the short description of the destination room is used in the message instead of the direction you left.

Iizuka fixed a typo in /cmds/wiz/trans.c reported by Loriel. Line 38: "disappears" is corrected.

Iizuka changed take_a_swing() in /std/adversary/main.c to only add "disarm" events if the target is wielding a weapon; otherwise it will add a "miss" event.

Iizuka changed /std/adversary/main.c->take_a_swing() not to switch() on panic(). This may have been a remnant of the old monster code, but it looks like a bug now. There was a condition where stop_fight() would be called without checking to see if the opponent wanted to stop. Rather than switching, we simply call panic() now.

Iizuka made a couple changes to health/limb.c->diagnose() so that health wouldn't be updated before messages are made (resulting in a message of "0"). Thanks to Loriel.

Tigran fixed an error in /cmds/verbs/sit.c

Tigran fixed the bug in M_COMPLEX_EXIT pointed out by Loriel wrt query_method_destination().  PORTAL should now work.

Iizuka fixed M_AGGRESSIVE as reported by Loriel. Aggressive adversaries no longer attack themselves.

Iizuka applied Darklord's fix to webed.c so that ^M doesn't get written to the end of every line of the file.

Iizuka added is_{vital,system,wielding,mobile}_limb() to /std/adversary/health/limbs.c.

Iizuka applied Rassilon's patch to /obj/admtool/secure/user.c so that receive_name_for_wiz() fails if the name isn't a real user name.

Iizuka removed /help/wizard/bin/findfunc because we don't have that command anymore.

Iizuka changed /obj/mudlib/water.c to inherit FLUID rather than OBJ and M_GETTABLE.

Iizuka installed a new pac_sword.c to /domains/std/objects. This one is written by me and Loriel.

Tigran finally got vehicular movement pretty much fixed.  (CONTAINER, M_EXIT, /cmds/verbs/drive, M_SMARTMOVE, /cmds/verbs/go.c....think that's all)

Tigran fixed a small typo in /std/object/vsupport.c at line 59.  It was direct_look_at_obj instead of direct_look_for_obj

Tigran updated /domains/std/camaro.c to remove the inventory_accessible() apply from it.

Tigran updated CONTAINER's inventory_accessible() apply to always return 1.  This is going tob reak some things, for now, but they should be fixed shortly as direct() and indirect() applies are fixed to handle the runtime possibilities.

Tigran made a fix to /std/object/vsupport.c's direct_get_obj().  It now checks to make sure that the environment of the object and this_body() are the same.

Iizuka changed set_level() in /std/adversary/advancement/level.c to check this_body()->query_link() before trying to save_me(). Thanks to Loriel for pointing this out.

Iizuka applied Loriel's solution to Rodney's bug where inventory listings were fucked up when (among other times) WIELD_MULTIPLE is defined.

Iizuka added query_experience() and add_experience() to /std/adversary/advancement/level.c. This file should probably be renamed 'simple.c' really.

Iizuka installed /cmds/player/team.c, /obj/mudlib/team_menu.c, /daemons/team_d.c, and updated /include/mudlib.h with respect to these. I'll post some information about this addition to news soon.

Iizuka moved /std/adversary/advancement/level.c to simple.c and changed /include/combat_modules.h to refer to it as ADVANCEMENT_SIMPLE. This is more sensible I think.

Iizuka added an admtool module for controlling methods. /obj/admtool/daemons/method.c.

Tigran tweaked direct_get_obj_from_obj() in /std/object/vsupport.c This should at least partially correct the problem pointed out in Loriel's post (which is removed).

Iizuka changed /obj/admtool/daemons/method.c to verb_method.c and changed its key from 'm' to 'v' so it doesn't conflict with the 'previous menu' option in admtool.

Tigran did work on /std/object/vsupport.c.  Removed direct_get_obs() from it, it's not used, direct_get_obj() is.

Iizuka changed /cmds/player/team.c lines 110 and 112 so that some prompts are displayed correctly during team creation process.

Tigran modified direct_put_obj_wrd_obj() in vsupport.c.  It now works a little better.

Tigran modified indirect_verb_rule() of CONTAINER to check that the relation is valid

Iizuka changed the team creation/joining process a little bit and moved the relevant code from /cmds/player/team.c to /obj/mudlib/team_menu.c.

Iizuka changed MAX_ATTEMPTS to 3 in /obj/mudlib/team_menu.c.

Iizuka fixed /obj/mudlib/team_menu.c so that max attempts actually works in password confirmation. =)

Tigran wrote indirect_verb_rule into CONTAINER.  It may still need some work, or other parsing functions may yet require some modification

Tigran changed the newsreader so that the list of all messages in a group now utilizes the message ID of the post.  In addition #<article number> now goes to the article of that ID rather than it's position in the queue.  Numbers will appear out of order due to threading, but now also searches and the like are useful again.

Tigran notes...this does not fix the imroper scrolling in news (i.e. going backwards then forwards through the list)

Tigran did some more changes to the newsreader.  It's mostly internal stuff and probably still will not fix the misordering problem, but does do a bit of internal cleanup.

Tigran fixed a couple typo's in the newsreader code..sorry

Tigran fixed ED_SESSION so that it is more restrictive in commands when in the restricted mode of ed.  Basically for players, and if the editor is in restricted mode, any command that reads or writes a file is disabled.  If you don't have any privileges at all by default that means you are a player and shouldn't have any access to any file in the game.

Iizuka installed RACE_D (/daemons/race_d, updated daemons.h), and moved all relevant code from NEW_USER_D into USER (I think it's all in sw_body.c now).

Iizuka changed login.c userinfo.c and sw_body.c. Almost all of the changes were in sw_body.. I'm actually not sure if much was changed in the other two except for pretty-printing because those files were so atrocious looking. Either way, they've changed for the better. =)

Tigran removed NEW_USER_D.  With Iizuka's last changes, it should be completely unnecessary now and we don't want to confuse people anymore than causes us to laugh.

Tigran fixed set_default_relation() in CONTAINER to check to see that hte relation is valid first, and removed the default of "in" for the default relation

Tigran fixed the small mailbox's error reported by Loriel

Tigran implemented a fix pointed out by Loriel in CONTAINER where the maximum capacity was never actually set.

Tigran made heavy enhancements to M_READABLE including autodoc'ing several functions, adding additional functions to handle entries and synonyms, allowing filenames used to be relative rather than absolute, and fixing read_entry(as reported by Loriel)

Tigran fixed LIVING so that there was a default relation.  Not having it caused problems.

Tigran hacked vsupport to handle targetted emotes and such again.  It is a temporary fix and not complete.

Iizuka fixed a bug in /obj/mudlib/team_menu.c that was preventing multiple people from joining a team. Also added "\n" output after the secure modal inputs.

Tigran fixed M_READABLE to detect file existance properly.  Bug reported by Loriel

Tigran removed the molest verb.  Didn't work right anyway, should be a soul.

Tigran added clear_entries() to M_READABLE

Iizuka fixed handle_events() in /std/adversary/blows/base.c so that i is incremented before each 'continue' statement. This should fix the "*Too long evaluation" error that Loriel reported.

Rust fixed Deathblade's stupid broken su code.

Iizuka added custom death messages for adversaries. set_death_message(string) to customize your monsters. Added /std/adversary/death/death_messages.c, modified /std/adversary.c, /std/adversary/death/{corpses,vaporize}.c.

Tigran added at token d to $N/$T for M_MESSAGES.  This token is similar to the p token except that it does a_short() instead of short().

Tigran updated the flip verb to use NVERB_OB instead of VERB_OB

Tigran updated the knock verb to use NVERB_OB instead of VERB_OB

Tigran fixed the light verb to use NVERB_OB instead of VERB_OB

Tigran updated the following verbs to use NVERB_OB instead of VERB_OB: mount, open, pick, pull, read, ring, smell, swim, talk, throw, wade, wave, whisper, wish

Tigran fixed DOC_D so that it properly updates when a complete_scan() is done, when it is initially loaded, or if a file is newer than the time of the last update.  A side effect of this is that TODO, FIXME and some other similar tags can now have multiple entries for the same file, rather than just the last entry being written to the file (the file is rm'd in a more appropriate place)

Tigran fixed the tell command to be consistant for emotes between local and remote.

Tigran fixed /daemons/imud/emoteto.c so that the format of emotes in tells is consistant with the tell command too

Tigran fixed a problem with M_MESSAGES

Tigran completed the nasty Himself/Herself bugfix in M_MESSAGES

Tigran fixed IMUD_D (/daemons/imud/emoteto) so that it didn't send tokens through the remote emotes (done via tell.)  It's up to the remote mud to handle the message, not the local mud to enforce it.

Tigran fixed exec_code in /secure/simul_efun/misc to handle capital letters as well as lowercase.

Tigran fixed SECURE_D to not accept null strings as a valid name. -- Fix originally pionted out by Beldin and perfected by Beek

Tigran changed ls to no longer use colour-ls but to use the standard ansi check like all the other colours do.  Fix proposed by Antilles

Tigran fixed a small error in the newsreader that reported the wrong message number on the message prompt.  It now reflects the proper number

Tigran fixed the look command by reactivating the STR rule.  This eliminates the annoying message that is returned if an object isn't found.  (i.e. look at the car'  There is no at the car here.)

Tigran implemented a fix to M_MESSAGES which was mucking up some of the pronouns (Courtesy of Loriel)

Tigran fixed a couple of typo's in the rm() portions of DOC_D (they were missing some trailing /'s)  Also removed another place where a file was rm'd and shouldn't have been.  (first pointed out by Loriel)

Tigran fixed mv to not so that mv file1 file1 fails and does not remove the file.

Tigran fixed ANSI_D so that it should load with CONFIGURABLE_COLOURS undefined

Tigran made a small fix to M_SMARTMOVE changing notify_move() to tell this_object() instead of this_body().  Fix suggested by Loriel

Tigran fixed a bug in M_FOLLOW that didn't remove the current followee when you stopped following something.  Also cleaned the code up a little bit

Tigran protected the ipname/number of users in FINGER_D (thorugh PLAYER_INFO_IS_PUBLIC)

Tigran fixed /domains/std/web.c to also inherit M_LIGHT_SOURCE

Tigran added NEWS_D to the preload file list.  Thought it was already done.

Tigran fixed /domains/std/objects/hole.c to handle the new container code, moved it to /std/hole.c and added HOLE to <mudlib.h>.  /domains/std/objects/sand_with_treasure also now points to the proper location of HOLE

Tigran fixed a bug in /domains/std/large_oak_door.  It was not accepting or passing arguments to on_clone()

Tigran tweaked HIDDEN_DOOR DOOR and M_SIBLING tomake doors work properly again

Tigran made changes to M_WANDER.  It now uses what should be the proper hooks.

Zifnab put a change into http_d around line 250 to stop people from doing ../../../ to get to any file in the mudlib.  its not a very elegant solution, and if anyone another way to do that please do so.

Tigran implemented a fix to M_MESSAGES from Megaboz.  Incorrect } placement

Tigran made a fix to direct_read_obj() of M_READABLE.  It doesn't do much good to check if the person has the object to be read or not after the reading occurs

Tigran made another fix to M_READABLE so that the other direct_* behave like direct_read_obj()

Tigran fixed DOC_D so that it doesn't error anymore and will actually properly rebuild the helpfiles again

Tigran fixed NEWS_D so that it will load out of startup.

Tigran installed a new BOOK.  This one has a lot more functionality than the old one.  There may still be some to be added to it, but this is a very good start. (You might also need to update M_READABLE).  Example in /wiz/tigran/tests/book.c

Tigran installed RCP_D courtesy of Dunedain.  The new file resides in /secure/daemons/rpc_d.  Changes were required to <ports.h> <log.h> <daemons.h> and /data/config/preload.  The RCP_PORT is __PORT__ + 5

Tigran fixed CORPSE to work with the new container system.  It was also moved from /obj/mudlib to /std and <mudlib.h> updated to reflect this change

Tigran fixed SECURE_D.  It had a query_prevent_shadow() apply which should have been a query_allow_shadow() apply.  If you don't allow shadows, (my recomendation), this won't affect you.  If you do...

Tigran fixed BED so that it has the proper default relation.

Iizuka changed line 82 of /std/adversary/wield/limbs.c from this_body() to this_object() in do_wield().

Loriel reinstated Tigran's new version of mount (/cmds/verbs/mount.c) which had somehow been lost and overwritten by an older version

Loriel amended /std/nverb_ob.c so that the check_vision() checks "outside" if appropriate - so you can see from horses etc...

Loriel fixed the horse (in /domains/std/) so that it now works again, though it could do with more cleaning up later, together with M_MOUNTABLE.

Dunedain added an option to turn didlog notifications on (didlog /on) and off (didlog /off).  (This is in response to the overwhelming number of didlogs being posted since Loriel became an admin.)

Loriel amended NON_ROOM (/std/non_room.c), putting colour into the short and exits in do_looking() to be consistent with a normal room "look"

Loriel amended M_FLUID_CONTAINER (/std/modules/m_fluid_container.c), fixing a number of minor bugs and omissions and adding a get_extra_long() showing how full the container is, similar to M_EDIBLE.

Loriel amended CHEST (/std/chest.c), adding a default relation "in".

Loriel amended /domains/std/dish.c, adding a line: set_default_relation("in");

Loriel amended M_BLOCKEXITS (/std/modules/m_blockexits.c), removing an apparently unneeded line 92 :- write( "FOO\n");

Loriel amended /std/adversary/state_of_mind.c so that query_stunned() returns 0 or 1, instead of the time the stun wears off - consistent with diagnose messages in health.

Loriel amended LANTERN (/std/lantern.c) by calling object::mudlib_setup() and light_object::mudlib_setup() (in order to correctly initialise the decay/fuel usage), and also set the fuel to save (ie num_decays).

Loriel amended TORCH (/std/torch.c) by calling weapon::mudlib_setup() and light_object::mudlib_setup() (in order to correctly initialise the decay/fuel usage), and also set the fuel to save (ie num_decays), and also adding set_decay_auto_remove(1) so dead torches are removed.

Tigran fixed LOG_D to accept the RCP log as a legal log

Loriel amended /domains/std/objects/backpack.c, adding the relation "in" and setting it as default.

Loriel amended CORPSE (/std/corpse.c), adding the relation "on" and setting it as default.

Loriel amended /domains/std/rooms/caves/Grotto.c, changing set_default_exit() to set_default_error()

Loriel amended /std/object/move.c, adding a check for MOVE_OK into give_new_obj() so recursion should now work correctly.

Loriel provided an extended version of M_ACTIONS (/std/modules/m_actions.c) with set_actions() working again, using a system similar to M_WANDER so the actions will pause with no players in the room, resume when a player enters.

Loriel fixed various parts of the quest, including file names specified in the quest daemon and changes in the following files : /domains/std/rooms/caves/Inside_Cave.c, Low_Crawl.c, Small_Dock.c, /domains/std/objects/dock_wall.c, navigation_table.s, rock_wall.c, and HOLE (/std/hole.c).

Dunedain modified 'say' to provide two kinds of history: history that follows the body around (#ifdef PER_BODY_SAY_HISTORY) or history that sticks to the room (#ifndef PER_BODY_SAY_HISTORY).

Loriel fixed a number of alternative spellings of FUNCTION which were causing errors in DOC_D. Files involved were M_FOLLOW, M_BLOCKEXITS, M_COMPLEX_EXIT and CONTAINER

Loriel amended STAIRS (/std/stairs.c), replacing "climb up" with "ascend" and "climb down" with "descend", as the existing methods try to put you in a non-existent relation "up" or "down" in the destination room. The methods "climb up" and "climb down" were deleted, and "ascend" and "descend" added, with "climb up" and "climb down" as equivalents.

Loriel amended /domains/std/web.c, adding a default relation "in" so it no longer gives errors on "look" (due to problems in introducing its non-existent inventory).

Loriel fixed /std/adversary/blows/class_simple.c, which was missing the word "class" in line 11

Dunedain modified /obj/admtool/secure/security.c to use more(sprintf()) instead of printf() in privilege_owners() so that even large numbers of privilege owners can be printed without exceeding maximum printable string length.

Tigran made modifications to /std/object/vsupport, CONTAINER, and M_COMPLEX_EXIT.  Mods include streamlining the function calls, making it more readable, and adding relation 'alias' support (so you can alias the relation 'on' to 'in' in the case of a bed or something similar).

Tigran removed the #include <combat_modules.h> line from ADVERSARY, /std/adversary/mod_config.c, /std/classes/event_info.c, M_DAMAGE_SOURCE, and M_WIELDABLE and put it into <config.h>

Tigran reorganized config.h and added some comments etc.  Hopefully this will deteur some of the obvious questions that get asked.

Tigran removed the MONSTER define from mudlib.h  Anything that blows up should be changed to ADVERSARY

Tigran removed the GHOST define from mudlib.h (it was bogus anyway)

Tigran tweaked the release script so that it will include the driver docs.

Tigran tweaked the release script to prune out emacs backup files (*~)
