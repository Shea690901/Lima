Deathblade updated the I3 daemon's version, too (I should automate this... 
    :-) 

Cowl wrote a quickie cgi that will find, and display in an unordered list, 
    all wizards with web dirs, clickable to get to thier home pages 
    (/WWW/cgi/homepages.c) 

Ohara fixed that persistant finger bug. 

Ohara removed a lot more bugs from the bug spool. Could someone with more 
    clues than me please go through it and clean it up sometime :) 

Rust added: http://lima.imaginary.com:7958/cgi/changes.c 

Cowl changed the seperator between filename and arguments in a URL from '?' 
    to the standard '?=' in the http daemon 

Rust added http://lima.imaginary.com:7958/fingeruser.html which allows you 
    to finger a user. If a user didn't supply a homepage for their finger 
    info, and they've got a mud homepage, a link to that is given by the 
    finger_d as their homepage. 

Rust added a bunch of mudlist/info web stuff for people whoose browsers 
    support tables. http://lima.imaginary.com:7958/mudlist.html 

Ohara fixed the reporter bug/typo/idea/todos to save 2 lines per post. PS: 
    There's a hell of a lot of redundancy in the four functions. This 
    should probably be fixed. 

Beek made a clog entry just so I would show up on Rust's CGI. Sorry guys 
    :-) 

Deathblade fixed NEWS_D to save itself after posts are removed. 

Ohara changed channels so that /who and /list are equivalent. 

Zifnab fixed it so that return at the main menu of the alias menu quits the 
    menu 

Ohara and Dana and Perk decided to kick Zifnab off and rename Lima Bean to 
    Ozmud. 

Rust removed the _d from the file names of all the daemons. 

Rust added an assert.h assert(x) works if DEBUG is on, and ASSERT(x) always 
    works. They can not be embedded in an expression intentionally (they 
    must be used as standalone statements). 

Rust added a spell system, and 2 tiny examples in /domains/std/spells (You 
    have to be a wizard to use one, and you have to be in the stock mage 
    guild and level 1 in the guild to use the other). Next time I'm here, 
    I'll do some more examples. 

Rust added smell and listen support. You can define a smell () or a sound 
    () function in an object, which should handle what happens when someone 
    smells or listens to the object. 

Rust updated /USAGE a bit. We've mentioned in a few places that you're not 
    to change the mudlib name w/o permission, and now it is formalized 
    there. Also, we now require that you display the mudlib name on the 
    title screen unless you have permission. 

Ohara fixed mail so that a return will take you to the next message, or 
    quit if you have no more mail. 

Ohara fixed that bug in more where a n on the last one would overrun. 

Ohara fixed the plan bug where ~q-ing would error. 

Ohara fixed the bug in the banish menu of the admtool. 

Ohara changed more so that news/mail using it wouldn't bug. hitting 'n' now 
    terminates the current post.. It would be nice to have it go straight 
    to the next post. FFF. 

Ohara fixed didlog with a little help from my friends .... 

Deathblade moved shell variables to just the wizard shell. More changes 
    coming... 

Deathblade moved the (arbitrary) prompt functionality from the generic 
    shell to the wizard shell. 

Ohara fixed the M_MESSAGE to not bug out when passed a null string. 

Deathblade moved default aliases to ALIAS_D (/daemons/alias). moved the 
    save file from /data/std/alias.o to /data/daemons/alias.o. move the 
    M_ACCESS from M_ALIAS to WISH 

Zakk fixed all the commands that used M_INPUT to allow more than one person 
    to use them. 

Rust moved .login handling from the body to the user, since it didn't work 
    when it was in the body. your .login won't handle aliases, I think 

Ohara fixed mudlist -s to be case insensitive. 

Deathblade added channel restrictions to the daemon; added /new; torched 
    achan, ichan, wchan; see "help channels" 

Deathblade wanted to note the changes in data files lately that are COMPAT 
    BUSTERS: /data/std/alias.o moved to /data/daemons/alias.o. Some of 
    those aliases changed to no longer use wchan and ichan. Many channels 
    need to have their options updated to be permanent (wiz) channels. A 
    channel_d.o will be shipped with the lib that has the right flags. 

Deathblade added channel history. Use /last on your favorite channel :-). 
    Limit of 20 lines (configurable in config.h). 

Ohara fixed news to print "msg" instead of "msgs" when there is <2 posts 
    left. 

Deathblade moved GROUP_D to /daemons and added management via admtool. 

Ohara cleaned up lima.ideas .. as with lima.bugs, more work is needed to 
    cut stuff that's now redundant :) 

Zifnab added basic support for dropping and getting coins. rules are 
    drop_wrd_str and get_wrd_string, object is /std/coins (probably needs 
    to move) 

Beek changed Ohara's news fix to do it the right way: number_of(last_id, 
    "msg" ) 

Ohara complains bitterly about undocumented features, and there use in one 
    line fixes which would be easier to do than fill the bug spool with ;) 

Beek changed update -z to consider files loaded at the same time to _not_ 
    be out of date with respect to each other 

Deathblade changed hit_points::reduce_hp() to die when hp <= 0, not just < 
    0. Monsters that hit 0 wouldn't die and couldn't be attacked to finish 
    them off. 

Deathblade moved REPORTER to REPORTER_D since it was never cloned or 
    subclassed. moved replicated functionality in from bug/typo/idea/todo. 

Deathblade updated the player menu to not require a force. Many player 
    commands now have a new func: player_menu_entry() which typically calls 
    main(). It could apply extra security or limitations if needed (as 
    main() is normally very secure) 

Deathblade changed /obj to have Mudlib:objects on it 

Beek made reduce_hp() static, to prevent abuse 

Beek made massive modifications to how combat results are handled; it is 
    now abstracted and uniform across combat systems. Note: it hasn't been 
    tested yet, so it's probably broken. I'll get back to it. 

Ohara is fairly sure he fixed the newsreader bug .. when it had no 
    newsgroups it was trying to use a %s without passing an arg (in this 
    case mud_name()) 

Deathblade converted sw_user.c to use USER_D rather than the old whacko 
    USERLIST_D to fetch the password. It does an unguarded() appropriately, 
    so it can now actually _get_ the password when you su (it used to bug 
    on this cuz it didn't have privs). 

Deathblade nuked the old USERLIST_D. It is so old and ugly that it would be 
    harder to update than to write from scratch. Its concept might even be 
    bogus given the existence of new mechanisms. 

Deathblade added a thread_id to class mail_msg for possible mail message 
    threading in the future. 

Deathblade updated the mail message storage to use class mail_msg rather 
    than the old many-variable approach. 

Deathblade separated mail processing from mailbox handling. The former is 
    the good old MAIL_D. The latter is now MAILBOX_D (/daemons/mailbox.c). 
    MAIL_D is still secure. 

Deathblade fixed up simple.c so that it at least loads. No guarantees on 
    functionaly, as Beek said, but at least the mud will come up :-) 

Ohara announces that lima.bugs is down to >100< posts. Ohara also notes 
    that this is pre-post-alpha bug fixing. If DB can redefine language, so 
    can he. 

Beek discovered that combat, suprisingly, works. 

Beek moved stunned/knockout handling to /std/living/state_of_mind, and also 
    moved duplicated code in simple and tradition combat up to the combat 
    base. 

Beek added check_condition() to verb_ob, which checks whether a player is 
    stunned/asleep 

Beek changed the default can_* function to check light and condition. Verbs 
    which define can_* functions (but not direct_*, etc) should check the 
    result of the default_checks() routine 

Beek added a query_ghost() check as well 

Beek fixed diagnose to actually say something useful 

Ohara fixed mudinfo to show info on the current mud when no arg given 

Ohara moved uptime to time, cutting out some redundancy. 

Deathblade got VERB_OB to load after some recent edits (nudge nudge). There 
    is still a problem in the default_checks() function where it needs a 
    value and I have no idea where to get it from. 

Ohara added leave and disembark as synonyms for exit .. He also restored 
    the "" rule. 

Ohara ripped /include/obbits.h 

Ohara ripped /std/object/bits.c . .. blame DB if anything explodes :) 

Ohara added c/-c and C/-C options to news .. the first will only put you in 
    news if there are unread groups, and the second just shows unread 
    groups without entering news 

Ohara changed errors to date and timestamp. 

Ohara wrote moreob .. allows you to more an object by using an id. 

Beek fixed /std/verb_ob to not need an action; small tweaks to 
    /std/living/state_of_mind as well 

Beek fixed basename() to distinguish between basename(0) and basename() 

Ohara fixed home to just twitch when in your home .. 

Ohara fixed wizz to twitch when in wizroom .. 

Beek made more accept objects 

Deathblade updated objcount to have an optional numeric arg to specify the 
    cutoff level for display of obs. 

Deathblade changed the command rule for "more" back to just "file*" until 
    CMD_D is fixed. It doesn't like "obj|file*" and that broke "more" 
    completely. 

Deathblade moved CMD_D to /secure/daemons 

Rust changed the map-type stuff to area. Now room has: set_area () and 
    get_area (). set_area takes an arbitrary string, which is the name of 
    your area. It'll eventually be used to keep wandering monsters in one 
    place, and could be used for weather, etc.... 

Rust updated the pirate area to use set_area ( "pirate" ) 

Rust moved /std/room.c to /std/base_room.c and made simple indoor_room and 
    outdoor_room subclasses. indoor_room is now ROOM when you do: inherit 
    ROOM; 

Rust noted: the difference between indoor and outdoor rooms is only 
    weather, right now (plus is_indoors(), is_outdoors()) 

Rust noted that outdoor rooms can be gotten by inheriting OUTDOOR_ROOM 

Rust updated the outdoor rooms in the domains/std stuff to inherit 
    OUTDOOR_ROOM 

Deathblade implemented BASE_OBJ as a common base class or *SPARSE_OBJ and 
    OBJ. Simplified the sparse obs 

Rust fixed weather so that it works again 

Deathblade moved CMD, DAEMON, MAILER, SHELL, and SOCKET to a new directory: 
    /secure/obj 

Rust changed room::create () to ::create() in example rooms =( 

Rust added a compatibility module: room::create() will be valid in r10, but 
    in the release after that, it'll cease to work. 

Deathblade renamed player.c to body.c (and its subdir and stuff) 

Deathblade tweaked CMD to tell it that it is no in /secure/obj/cmd.c 

Deathblade updated a number of files to remove /std dependencies. I updated 
    /data/config/preload. etc. New locations of files seem okay now. 

Beek fixed the http daemon not to throw an error whenever someone connects 
    (/std/socket passes zero to the read callback) 

Beek added an autodoc CGI; check out 
    http://lima.imaginary.com:7958/cgi/autodoc.c; the most impressive one 
    is http://lima.imaginary.com:7958/cgi/autodoc.c?=tree-body ;-) 

Deathblade fixed up the ROOM compatibility module. Recall: change all 
    room::create() uses to just ::create(). Optionally, change inherit 
    ROOM; to inherit INSIDE_ROOM; or inherit OUTSIDE_ROOM;. This compat 
    feature will disappear in a future release.
