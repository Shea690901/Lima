Deathblade converted all input handlers to use M_INPUT and fixed the imp of 
    M_INPUT to make it more robust against changes in this_user() from call 
    to call. 

Deathblade broke the alias menu out into /obj/aliasmenu.c 

Deathblade fixed somebody's addition of ADMTOOL to commands.h. It should 
    have been CMD_OB_ADMTOOL. 

Deathblade fixed the player menu's problems with [nwbti?l] commands. 

Deathblade fixed a nasty security hole. Released 0.9r2-patch1. 

Deathblade fixed a problem with player shells. user ob was getting level 1, 
    causing it become a wiz, causing /std/player to create a wizard shell 
    (wish). user ob is no longer always set to level 1. 

Deathblade fixed the converse command to not prepend say 

Deathblade fixed the alias menu in the admtool. 

Deathblade made the newsreader print the total number of msgs in a group on 
    the group prompt line. 

Deathblade fixed a bug in /std/modules/input.c for modal_simple(). it may 
    not always have input_user defined. switched back to this_user() which 
    should be fine, given modal_simple's semantics. 

Deathblade fixed addemote to pass its values thru fptrs rather than use 
    global vars. Should prevent errors that were being seen due to 
    simultaneous usage of the cmd. 

Deathblade upgraded news_d (and company) to use classes for the posts. 

Deathblade added a rudimentary post removal to the news daemon/reader 

Deathblade applied Robo's patch to the newsreader to enable <CR> at the 
    main prompt to drop you out. 

Deathblade modified finger.c to select a mud with an exact match rather 
    than failing, saying it could match (foo or foobar) (i.e. you couldn't 
    ever finger @foo) 

Deathblade removed some posts from lima.bugs... whew. only partway though. 
    admins can remove any. a non-admin can remove their own (fyi). 

Deathblade added a first pass at stats. see /std/modules/bodystats. see the 
    "stats" command. 

Deathblade wanted to mention you can generate stats for yourself with: 
    @.me->init_stats() 

Deathblade added a "todo" command 

Deathblade removed /std/ghost.c. 'nuf said. 

Beek added M_ACCESS inherit and an set_priv to the file created in 
    exec_code() priv 1 evals actually have priv 1. If your eval.h has 
    M_ACCESS in it, you'll need to remove that now. 

Deathblade removed the level concept. We will move towards a string naming 
    a wiz's "position" in the mud instead. level 0/1 for player/wiz is now 
    detected via SECURE_D. 

Deathblade rebuilt the driver with NO_WIZARD. added a wizardp() simul. 
    removed enable/disable wizards. hacked some minor body fname stuff for 
    now. 

Deathblade fixed up code throughout the lib to deal without levels. several 
    simuls were removed. some optimized. 

Deathblade modified the admtool's user menu to alter the wiz/dewiz feature. 
    it now forces an su. it no longers sets a level. 

Deathblade fixed auto-wiz. It now creates a "real" wizard in the SECURE_D. 

Beek fixed nicknames to add the id when you log in, so they work again. 

Beek added a -v flag to the parse command for the really super spammy debug 
    info; it'll work as soon as we're on a driver with DEBUG enabled. 

Beek modified ansi() in M_ANSI to have an optional second arg which 
    indicates who the message is for. 

Beek added made 'Foo tells you' come out in bold if you have ansi on. 

Deathblade improved admtool's internal structure. altered some priv checks. 
    added the "domain admin" menu. other small tweaks/improvements to it. 

Deathblade created a "checkpriv" command to verify if you are operating 
    with a particular privilege. 

Beek added %^SAVE%^, %^RESTORE%^ and %^HOME%^ to M_ANSI 

Deathblade removed GROUP_D->adminp() usage. admin status is now defined by 
    membership within the Admin domain. 

Ohara wrote up ~ohara/stats which is a suggested breakdown of the secondary 
    stats .. feedback to DB 

Yaynu made a basic weather-daemon 

Deathblade broke the player shell out of the body into PLYR_SHELL 
    (/obj/pshell). fixed up save and destroy of shell obs. 

Rust added [idle] to your in_room_desc if you've been idle for 2 minutes or 
    more 

Beek added a bodies() simul 

Rust changed master::object_name to say: "rust's body" instead of NPC 

Ohara wrote a rough draft for some basic skills/catagories .. 
    comments/suggestions to lima.ideas pls .... 

Deathblade thrashed hard on mudlist.c. displays mudlib by default now. use 
    -t to display type instead (old behavior). filters muds to display only 
    UP muds. use -a to display all muds. internally it now has a flexible 
    system for selecting columns and widths of stuff to display. 

Yaynu READ THE LIMA WWW PAGE AT: http://lima.imaginary.com 

Beek changed whisper to a verb, as a test case. Also modified it to use the 
    message module. 

Beek added 'whisper to LIV STR' and 'whisper STR to LIV' 

Deathblade removed cwf and pwd from /std/dev. they are now part of wish.c. 
    modified appropriate commands/files. 

Deathblade modified the start up and reconnect of the shell ob. much 
    simpler now. 

Deathblade fixed the su problem with shells. 

Deathblade wanted to note that aliases work at the first cmd now, due to 
    the restructuring of shell startup/teardown/reconnect. Prompt is 
    forthcoming :-) 

Deathblade obsoleted /std/dev. /std/player is now used for players and 
    wizzes. just the shell is different. moved DEV funcs to 
    /std/player/wizfuncs.c. note the order of operations at login is 
    changed: move to room, enter game, channel signup for new users, dump 
    DID data, run .login, look. 

Deathblade worked on the login sequence to separate character creation from 
    login. more of it uses modal_xxx now. 

Deathblade updated MORE_OB and M_ANSI to deal with no body/shell. 

Deathblade updated some of the query/set functions for the user ob. Also 
    changed plmenu and player/title. 

Deathblade wrote the didlog command. Some related changes in DID_D and 
    player.c. Format is: didlog num_days (num_days defaults to 1 day). It 
    will print the changes over the past num_days. 

Deathblade moved the logon DID_D report after the look because the "more" 
    doesn't block until completion, meaning you can get a "look" in between 
    your more prompts. 

Deathblade implemented the return_to_func in the input system. This 
    function is called whenever your input handler is returned to (after 
    another handler was popped). 

Beek updated /std/book.c to interact correctly with the parser 

Azy can't type, strange keyboard... 

Deathblade added a query_history() warning for the persion queried 

Rust ripped out Deathblade's query_history code, as he hadn't finished it, 
    and I felt like pissing him off. 

Beek added code to the did_d to verify that what gets reported actually 
    happened. 

Deathblade tweaked the history warning. only admins get it. 

Rust changed it so it says: You have left mudname instead of you have left 
    the game 

Beek added /ftp/incoming (for mudlib submissions), and moved a bunch of 
    files there, since the mail level of /ftp can get rather crowded. 

Beek added support for default exit behavior. Doc forthcoming. 

Beek added the doc in /help/wizard/lib/std/room or something like that 

Deathblade installed Aldernon's new rooms. Thanx, Aldernon! 

Deathblade revised the login code to use the modal input system. Cleaner. 
    Prompt now appears on login/reconnect. 

Deathblade made modal_recapture() static. Should only be used at startup 
    and internally by the input system. Removed from M_INPUT. 

Deathblade fixed a problem in the login sequence where you would mistype a 
    name twice and it would begin to log you in as that name. The new input 
    mechanisms helped this a lot. Also fixed some problems related to early 
    termination of the login sequence and call_outs. 

Zifnab fixed the problem with the listing of souls through the menu 

Beek re-added the 'laugh' emote. Anyone have any idea where it went? 

Zifnab started adding help files for some wiz cmds 

Zifnab didnt get as far as i would of liked tonight will contnue tomorrow 
    :) 

Deathblade added a check for NO_WIZARDS to check_config.c. 

Deathblade updated master::valid_bind() and dbxvars to apply restrictions 
    to variable inspection. valid_bind() is now a bit more lenient. 

Beek added number_of() to M_GRAMMAR. number_of(2, "dog" ) -> "2 dogs" 

Beek added support for idle time in hours and days 

Beek I fixed announce to use correct grammar 

Deathblade fixed a problem with logging in a second time and taking over 
    your body 

Rust added a truncate simul_efun that truncates a string to a specified 
    length and adds an elipsis ( "..." ) and then used it in who because 
    Yaynu was being really obnoxious about long titles. 

Rust reworked the in_room_desc code in player.c some so that when you 
    truncate the desc, you don't truncate the idle info. 

Earendil env 

Rust fixed the Bill the Cat Graphic for ack 

Deathblade fixed M_GRAMMAR to include some special cases that the driver 
    doesn't know about yet 

Deathblade revised a lot of the user/body system for mud entry. 

Beek removed /std/object/non_object.c 

Beek put non_object.c back :) 

Deathblade shifted the room's weather code to /std/room/weather. changed 
    WEATHER_D some to make it a bit more efficient. 

Deathblade fixed a couple problems in edit_ob dealing with ~r and ~w 

Beek added an obscene number of new emotes. 

Deathblade fixed trim_spaces() so it doesn't barf on empty strings or 
    all-white-space strings. 

Deathblade added a "random [ LIV ]" command for producing random emotes 
    (possibly targetted) 

Deathblade worked on stats some more. stats use the Official Ohara 
    Percentages[tm]. con and wis now support racial modifiers. 

Beek added $np, $tp: propper name 

Rust added do_read_word_str() support to read, so that it assumes what you 
    want to read from if it's clear. 

Rust made it so openable assigns the adjectives "open" and "closed" to an 
    object at the right time 

Rust changed the call to ob->extra() to ob->extra_short() in inv_list() 
    sefun 

Rust changed all _prep_'s I could find to _word_ 

Deathblade tweaked some logic in more_ob to avoid a driver bug. that ob 
    needs more help, though. 

Deathblade fixed Rust's non-loading version of M_OPENABLE. :-) 

Deathblade fixed some AUTO_WIZ problems: new wizzies didn't actually get
    their privs. After changing for correct privs, then needed to change
    the force_me() calls in enter_game().

Deathbladed added NO_ENVIRONMENT check to check_config.c
