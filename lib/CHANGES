Deathblade obsoleted query_real_name(). use query_userid() (on both body 
    and user). tweaked lots of files for this. 

Deathblade shifted body fname and body instance handling into sw_body. 
    cleaned up. added some data versioning of the link files to begin 
    upgrading them to nice, known formats and values. this is a precursor 
    to some race work. 

Beek fixed the player shell to print an nonsense message if 
    do_game_command() fails 

Beek added DEBUG_COMBAT to config_combat.h, and some code to print out info 
    on combat formulas when you attack 

Beek made the percentage penalty for attacking too often a define in 
    /std/monster/traditional.c, and doubled it from 5 to 10 

Beek fixed a rather nasty bug in traditional combat :-) See news for 
    details :-) 

Beek added a tell() function to player.c and user.c; player->tell(string) 
    is the same as tell_object(player, string). link->tell(string) is the 
    same as tell_object(link,string) in all cases that matter (no 
    catch_tell in user.c, etc) 

Beek added DEATH_MESSAGES to config_combat.h, and implemented them in 
    player.c 

Beek moved nonsense and discarded messages to the messages daemon 

Deathblade fixed the new character creation bug (needed to init body_fname) 

Rust fixed a bug Cyberspam found that just got added in the last 24 hours, 
    see news. see news. 

Beek added a quick hack to support verb synonyms, mainly b/c something is 
    better than nothing. Better support later. 

Beek fixed put X in Y to work again. 

Beek cleaned out lima.bugs. Only 114 out of 645 posts remain :-) 

Beek moved the overrides to first on the list of sefuns so they affect 
    later sefuns 

Beek made destruct() take an optional second arg, which is passed to 
    remove(). 

Beek added a -z flag to update; it walks the inheritance tree and updates 
    files that are out of date. 

Beek modified input_sys to handle "!" escapes at the mudlib level. Errors 
    are now handled correctly (i.e. the 'next command goes through to 
    shell' bug is gone.) 

Beek cleaned up lima.todo a bit 

Beek fixed update -z to check inherited objects as well as the source, so 
    it doesn't get fooled if some objects in the middle have been manually 
    updated. 

Beek moved ed setup to /secure/modules/userinfo. ~/.edrc is obsolete. You 
    will have to reset and save your ed setup. 

Beek fixed a bug in su'ing while in ed. 

Beek re-enabled 'sniff OBJ' now that the parser can disambiguate it [sniff 
    LIV is a feeling, sniff OBJ is a verb] 

Beek removed the 'two copies of self on stack' workaround from secure_d 

Beek changed all the ### comments in the lib to the correct //### form 

Ohara cleaned up news (mainly ideas/discussion) somewhat more .. still 
    needs another pass sometime to pick of even more duplication .. 

Beek fixed the bug in where.c that was causing crashes 

Beek added a hook to call NEW_USER_D in sw_body.c. Implemented NEW_USER_D 
    to allow a race to be selected. 

Beek added an orc race, just so that a choice exists. 

Beek added a documentation race, as a joke (type help documentation at the 
    race prompt). It also contains documentation on the various functions 
    race objects should define. 

Beek suggest that admins who want to pick a race edit their .o and set 
    their body_fname to zero. 

Beek added a troll race as an example of a non-boring race 

Beek fixed a void/int type error in /secure/modules/userinfo. 

Beek added M_WRITING_SURFACE, and /domains/std/paper.c as an example 

Beek added buy and sell verbs, M_VENDOR, and /domains/std/shopkeeper as an 
    example. They work about as well as they can without any money support 
    in the lib :-) 

Beek made it possible to give stuff to players 

Deathblade fixed another problem with privileges in doc_d. Needed an 
    unguarded() to halt stack tracing before falling off end of stack and 
    requiring a user, which doesn't exist in a call_out(). 

Beek fixed an the troll race to correctly pass the arg to create() to 
    player::create() 

Beek documented a file or two in /std/modules 

Deathblade began tweaking the shell for command execution changes (nothing 
    big yet beyond some plans) 

Deathblade fixed the saving of the ed_setup. Just added a call to save_me() 

Rust got the mail 

Beek made ls print a message when no files match; see news for 
    justification 

Beek removed the more_chunk var from player.c. Private, and unused. 

Beek fixed more to not claim zero-length files don't exist 

Beek changed more to (1) not clone an object for short mores, (2) no more 
    CHUNK=get_chunk_size() hack by moving the interface to 
    /secure/modules/more inherited by /secure/user. Help more/more_files 
    for info. 

Beek fixed a bug in force_game_command() that made it ALWAYS print a 
    nonsense message (is it used instead of do_* in the right places) 

Beek : that last parenthetical note was a question 

Beek changed the notorious 'Bad file name:' to 'Permission denied:' 

Beek fixed a bug in mkdir that would error when permission failed. 

Beek fixed the default description to get gender right 

Beek made tell use lower_case() on the user name 

Beek changed /std/modules/complete:complete() to use filter and not 
    regexp(). The original implementation would error often since it didn't 
    bother to protect regexp special characters. 

Beek made edit_ob truncate the printing of the included text if it is too 
    long 

Deathblade folded in Satan's mods for hidden exits and (configurably) 
    showing exits at the bottom of the description. 

Deathblade made all room vars private and static (COMPAT BUSTER). If you 
    have any code that directly used these, then it will need to change to 
    use public APIs. 

Deathblade torched add_exits() and remove_exits(), being too hard to use. 
    Instead, we now have add_exit() and remove_exit(). Add DOC for these. 

Deathblade move the rehashing to after do_game_command() processing. 
    players shells do not rehash any more, ever. 

Deathblade wanted to amend the last two: I _added_ doc. Wiz shells rehash; 
    player shells do not. 

Beek fixed a logic error in edit_ob that caused it to truncate the file if 
    you used ~e 

Beek fixed a typo in feelings 

Deathblade fixed a problem in the I3 daemon where it was possible that the 
    daemon might not retry for up to an hour after being dropping (rather 
    than retry a minute later). Added cancel_reconnection() into 
    rcv_startup_reply(). 

Beek fixed open OBJ with OBJ in open.c to handle 0 for objects correctly. 

Deathblade fixed the "tmp_hack" problem: there was a bug in the upgrading 
    of link files that was zeroing the userid. 

Deathblade moved around a lot of objects and modules; stuff in: /obj, 
    /std/modules/shell_support, /secure/modules, /trans. 

Beek fixed HELP_D to not barf on files in /help. Maybe it should just 
    ignore them? (c.f. help README) 

Beek changed gettable to use 1/0/error format instead of the -1/message 
    stuff; the old interface will work, but the 'right way' to do it now is 
    just set_gettable(message) and not set_gettable(-1); 
    set_getmsg(message). Also, clone no longer prints the get message of 
    non-gettable objects 

Beek : remove() now calls release_object(..., 1) 

Beek fixed people to not die on environment-less people 

Deathblade added the post # to followup posts 

Deathblade fixed a bug in the I3 daemon that prevented outgoing messages 
    after receiving a channel-e packet. 

Rust repaired a bug in nchannel_d that was keeping people from logging in 
    properly. Look for classp 

Deathblade removed Rust's hack (thanx) and fixed the actual bug... wrong 
    sense on an if() 

Deathblade fixed a nit in the news posting announcements: extra CR on the 
    end. 

Beek added /std/race/restricted; the correct place to put races which can't 
    be picked by new players. 

Beek added /std/stairs, /std/ladder, climb OBJ, climb up OBJ, climb down 
    OBJ, M_CLIMBABLE, /domains/std/attic [w/stairs to/from wizroom] 

Deathblade added a check to check_config.c to ensure people change their 
    mudname 

Deathblade added a check to imud_d.c to ensure that people change the 
    ADMIN_EMAIL in the distribution before the I3 daemon will start up. 

Yaynu added numeric level system to Lima dist. as a optional player.c 
    include. 

Deathblade fixed admtool to dewiz before nuking and to change the privs on 
    their wiz directory.
