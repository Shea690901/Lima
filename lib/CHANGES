Deathblade fixed a bug in did_d.c that made it so you couldn't see the 
    first entry. 

Rust added a shout simul_efun since the efun got messed up due to adding a 
    receive_message() in user that doesn't accept message classes 

Deathblade updated the I3 daemon to protocol version 3 (additional "locate" 
    information is now sent/returned/displayed). 

Rust removed the shout() sefun, instead made the receive_message have the 
    same prototype as the driver apply, so we don't get in the way of 
    people who for some reason want to use receive_message 

Rust fixed smartmove so that you don't see 2 messages when someone sits on 
    the bed (or uses any furniture) 

Rust redid VEHICLE. MOUNT subclasses it. Added a mount verb, and added get 
    on and get off. Also added dismount. 

Rust removed the MOUNT subclass, and added M_MOUNTABLE and M_ENTERABLE 

Deathblade fixed sparse_obj and less_sparse_obj to implement a set_light() 
    call to satisfy remove() in /std/object/non_object.c 

Deathblade tweaked the calls to parse_add_rule() for the new a14 driver. 

Deathblade removed a save_me() from the shutdown command. It was 
    superflouos. 

Deathblade cleaned out some temp casts (hacks) in /std/object/names.c that 
    I did during an a13 usage attempt. and released in r8 :-( 

Deathblade imp'd Rassilon's light fixes in lightable.c 

Deathblade fixed problems with set_variable() in USER_D 

Deathblade revised the "user" menu in admtool. Added setting of wizard 
    positions. 

Rust made it so that if you're in a vehicle, n,s,e,w mean "move this thing 
    xxx" 

Rust added support for A and The (note capitals) in M_MESSAGES 

Rust fixed a bug that wouldn't let you overload query_in_room_desc() and 
    get desired results 

Rust added functionality to the horse example so that it shows different 
    descriptions depending on how many riders it as 

Rust updated Deathblade's camaro. Someone remind me to add doors to it. 

Rust added show_contents to container, which does call inventory_recurse, 
    but is a bit more intuitive for overloading. 

Rust moved the code for showing descriptions based on the riders into 
    vehicle. If you did want to get rid of them, you could either close the 
    vehicle, or make inventory_visible return 0, or override 
    query_in_room_desc. 

Zifnab changed the lightme message x light added -> light set to x 

Rust am going to kick the ass of whoever put an old messages daemon back 
    in, it introduces an old bug that I fixed before r8 

Rust fixed that bug again BTW. Wee, now we can log on to Zork again. 

Zifnab added a room showing state descriptions 
    /domains/std/rooms/caves/north_cave.c and /domains/std/objects/gate.c 

Rust fixed it so that a soul w/ a bad rule gives a nonsense msg instead of 
    "I don't know that verb" 

Rust heard all about it =) 

Rust fixed a problem w/ setting or clearing the same room state twice, w/o 
    having done the other 

Deathblade made the newsreader save your state as you quit. Helps on those 
    link-deaths :-) 

Deathblade began installing Ohara's guild code. /daemons/guild_d.c and 
    /std/player/guilds.c. Need some thought on where the guildmaster goes. 
    More work to do overall; this was an FYI. 

Deathblade removed (un)banish.c. They allowed a banish of 0 which banned 
    _everything_. admtool is The One and Only Way now. Also added some 
    checks to banish_d.c to be more careful. 

Zifnab changed the catch_tell() in M_TRIGGERS to receive_outside_msg() 

Rust hooked in synonym support in verb_ob. Curse synonyms now work. 

Deathblade removed money.h and its corresponding include in 
    /std/player/money.c. Superflous file and include. 

Deathblade have created a very simple Guildmaster: 
    /domains/std/monsters/fighter_master. "Look" at him to see what to do. 
    More example guilds and masters on the way. 

Rust fixed robo's /close bug 

Zakk fixed container.c so you couldn't put things into a closed container. 

Rust added a get_brief() to room.c which just calls short(). Then made 
    people call that instead of short(), so we could get the right things 
    from rooms, furniture and vehicles 

Deathblade cleaned up M_GUILD_MASTER some; tweaked fighter_master.c; 
    tweaked player/guilds.c; added new fields/APIs to guild_defn in 
    GUILD_D; fixed the guild_is_ok() func in GUILD_D 

Deathblade made M_GUILD_MASTER repond properly to trying to leave a guild 
    you don't belong to. 

Zakk added support for ";" and ":" in tells. Works for local and I3 tells. 

Zakk changed rcv_emoteto() in /daemons/imud/emoteto.c to not add a "\n" to 
    the string. 

Zifnab fixed telnet so that only admins may use it 

Ohara cleaned up lima.bugs a little ... we really need to clean up some of 
    those bugs .. tehre are a _lot_ unfixed, some for 5+ months. Yes I know 
    the implications of prealpha. Call this prealpha preparations for 
    post-beta :) 

Deathblade fixed the setting of the "reply" person for tell 

Deathblade removed the "call" and "do" commands. The shell should be used 
    directly (or updated if it doesn't have some of the functionality of 
    call/do). 

Deathblade made posted articles and followups wrap the text before posting 
    to the NEWS_D. Note that existing posts are not affected. TFB. 

Ohara dunno .. muds that use "class" tend to assign you before you start .. 
    muds which use "guild" you join after you start ... 

Ohara ignore that .. and a small todo .. a way to rip a misplace I :) 

Deathblade created /data/config/guild-spec and a bulk-loading function in 
    GUILD_D. Added all of Ohara's example guilds. 

Zifnab added nickname to the finger information 

Beek fixed the messages module to handle fake numbers in $v correctly. 

Deathblade fixed the GUILD_D's handling of attributes. Ran some tests using 
    guild_is_ok() and it seems to be fine. 

Deathblade cleaned up /secure/user and its modules a bit. Fixed the "email 
    doesn't save" bug. 

Deathblade made the "hooks" variable in /std/object/hooks.c -- it was in 
    the player file :-) 

Beek removed a bunch of unnecessary this_object()->'s in description.c 

Beek made a bunch of changes to visibility handling; see news for info. 

Ohara did some stock guilds. You can't join them if you're a member of any 
    other guilds, and you can't leave them once you're in. 

Ohara wrote a guild_d doc .. It's in /help/wizard/lib at the 
    moment.feelfree to move it somewhere better (I couldn't find a place :) 

Beek removed the fidgeting with the ids of an object in visible.c; changed 
    short() to use invis_name() so that it returns 'someone' for livings, 
    and made the parser ignore invisible objects. 

Deathblade fixed a problem in body creation where the body always thought 
    it was for a new user; as a result, it would display "welcome new wiz" 
    and reset your channels. Please check the channels you listen to. 

Deathblade changed the wrap algorithm in the newsreader so that posts are 
    wrapped only if they exceed 78 characters. This should prevent 
    accidental wrap of "decent" posts. 

Deathblade changed the management of quit(). It is now in the user ob. The 
    user ob manages its own destruction now, too. 

Deathblade fixed "nickname" . It tried to remove the prior one, which could 
    have been 0. 

Deathblade changed NEW_USER_D to return DIR_RACES + "/human" if races 
    aren't defined 

Deathblade modified DIR_RACES in dirs.h to not have a trailing / to be more 
    consistent with other dirs in the lib. 

Deathblade added Magician's "halt" command to halt combat in a room. 

Deathblade added some USE_ flags to config.h and some comments. 

Deathblade fixed a problem in I3 "who" where we sent bad data to people. 

Deathblade added multiple guest logins. Each one gets a number on the end. 
    Since guests can't be wizards, no biggy. Also you can't type them at 
    the prompt, so you can't go to a specific guest. You just get the next 
    one available. 

Deathblade removed the "temporary" hack in do_game_command that tried to 
    load a verb file on _every_ game command (i.e. every emote) *sfbog* 

Deathblade fixed push's having a synonym for itself (parser doesn't like 
    that) 

Deathblade added virtual object support (master::compile_object()). Type 
    "help virtual" for info. 

Deathblade added GRID_SERVER (/std/grid_server) as an example of a virtual 
    object server and as a way for people to mass-create bogus rooms. :-) 

Deathblade added /domains/std/rooms/v_plains.c (and its companion data). 
    You can get to it by going 1e, 1n from the main room. It's an 8x8 grid. 

Deathblade moved /cmds/player/finger.c to /trans/cmds/finger.c. Added a 
    player finger.c that just does a "resend" to the "real" one. Assuming 
    /trans/cmds is in the path before /cmds/player (which it is by 
    default), admins will now have priv 1 when using finger and can see 
    private player data. 

Deathblade moved linkdeath timeout handling from the body to the user ob. 

Deathblade cleaned up some title related stuff in player.c, player/title.c, 
    and who.c. In particular, who.c now uses query_formatted_desc() which 
    will always be available, even when USE_TITLES is turned off. 

Deathblade update find_user() and find_body() to take an optional flag 
    indicating that linkdead users/bodies should be searched for. 

Deathblade added querying of the title to USER_D. 

Deathblade fixed up finger information dramatically. Now includes title, 
    position, linkdead status, idle, and homepage. Somebody else had added 
    the nickname in there, too (I don't recall if that was noted). 

Deathblade hid the connect-from field in the finger info from players. 

Deathblade added LOG_D (/secure/daemons/log_d.c) and rewrote all logging to 
    use it. It provides access to the priv 1 /log directory for non-privved 
    objects. Also provides a uniform mechanism for logging (we should look 
    into timestamps). 

Deathblade wanted to also point out log.h and that you log using: 
    LOG_D->log(which, message) where which comes from log.h. 

Deathblade decided to stop coding and get some sleep. *mgrin* 

Rust fixed log_d so that it'd load. Try updating files after you edit them 
    *smirk* 

Rust wondered who fucked w/ the mudlib so hard that obvious exits and 
    roomdescs and all sorts of things are hosed after a reboot. 

Rust changed config.h having obvious exits at the bottom and at the top 
    defined is bad 

Rust made it so wizing a person from the admintool who is already a wizard 
    but doesn't have a dir (autowiz for example) makes the dir and sets the 
    priv. 

Zakk changed the format of souls over tell to "(tell) blah" 

Zakk fixed emoteto after he screwed it up. 

Deathblade made the I3 daemon actually use its save file. It properly marks 
    muds as down at restore/disconnect time so that on a reconnect, things 
    are sync'd properly. 

Beek fixed update -z to load objects first before checking inherited object 
    modification times. Should always be right now. 

Beek updated the lib to correspond to the a18 parse_sentence() return 
    codes. 

Beek installed Cowl's socket mods [SKT_STYLE_LISTEN_B and CONNECT_B]; 
    needed for his httpd. 

Deathblade fixed /std/reporter to wrap posts so some people (cough) can't 
    continue typing in posts with long lines. 

Deathblade fixed a problem with linkdeath/reconnection. 

Beek managed to reduce save_autoload() from 12 lines to 2 lines, w/o any 
    loss of functionality 

Beek added PLAYERS_START_WHERE_THEY_QUIT to config.h 

Beek moved start_location handling to /std/player/start.c, and cleaned it 
    up a bit 

Beek also cleaned up load_autoload 

Cowl installed the http_d in /daemons/http_d.c. Configuration is in 
    /include/net/http_d.h 

Cowl wrote a few simple examples of cgi scripts for the http server. They 
    are in /WWW/cgi 

Cowl wrote some basic docs on the web server, in html format. they are in 
    the http_d's root, which is /WWW
