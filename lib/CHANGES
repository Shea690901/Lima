Rust installed Valentino's fix for snoopable stuff.

Rust fixed ftpd to idle out properly (it was closing the connection but still thought you were connected).

Rust fixed the did_d so that if there's no did information, you get something sensible, and not a 0

Rust made wizards w/o dirs start off in /ftp not in a non-existant dir in FTPD.

Rust added # of users to who and people cause he got sick of manually counting.

Rust fixed the more object not to retain your input if there is an error in initializing (eg, string too large)

Rust updated secure_d to fix the quota mapping when you rm a domain or wizard.

Rust fixed player things that more in the player menu to actually more instead of dying after 1 screen.

Rust fixed ansi so it works for players.

Rust made complex container load by making the overloaded query_prep varargs... didn't look deep enough to make sure this was the right fix

Rust added per-group archivability to NEWS_D.  Admins should be able to do @NEWS_D->set_archive_time("wiz.chat", 90)    To make wiz.chat archive posts over 90 days old.  Posts get archived whenever the NEWS_D loads, so mainly at reboot.

Deathblade fixed the channel daemon to allow both ";" and ":" for souls/emotes.

Rust added a user_exists simul_efun

Rust installed cowl's convert_time() function as a simul_efun.  The first arg is the # of seconds, the optional second arg will make the return be 5m instead of 5 minutes

Rust fixed mail_d to do a check_previous_privilege(1) in send_mail(), not a check_privilege()

Rust made I3 mail work =)

Rust noted that you should see news if you want to upgrade an older lib to use I3 mail.

Rust made it so to and cc lists are comma seperated, not space seperated.  You need to get /secure/obj/mailers/mailer.c for that.

Ohara fixed a small bug in SOUL_D's parse_imud_soul()

Ohara changed tells to sync with channels' usage of ;/:

Ohara added clear_guilds() function .. it's all of one line, but handy for testiers :)

Ohara wrote M_SECRET_DOOR ... the door to the quiet room uses it.

Ohara ntes that that is, of course, SECRET_DOOR

Rust don't see what's so secret about this secret door

Ohara notes that SECRET_DOORs are not visible via "exits" or the exits display. (It's quite possible that some muds will want to use them for all doors <shrug>) As of now, they are automatically attached.

Rust notes that a good secret door is invisible until "found"

Ohara notes that if Rust wants to feature extend it, he should feel more than free <smiles sweetly>

Ohara moved SECRET_DOOR to HIDDEN_DOOR complaints to Rust or /dev/null ...

Ohara added SECRET_DOOR ... it only displays "The door is open" and not "The door is closed" ... in the process ..

Ohara changed the add_hook("extra_long" ..) in M_OPENABLE .. the spam was folded out into the extra_long_stuff function ... This was done to make secret doors  much neater :)

Ohara updated and enchromed exits. People may note that it works best with cardinal directions/up/down/in/out.

Ohara wrote beep.c .... the bloody beep emote is now deprecated

Deathblade changed /secure/user/failures.c to use M_GRAMMAR-> rather than inheriting it (major security hole :-).

Deathblade changed all uses of simple_action() to remove the trailing \n. Note that I didn't reload most of them yet...

Deathblade modifed simple_action() to add the \n only if it isn't present. Note: xxx_action() should be similarly updated (much fewer though :-).

Zakk tried to call move::create() from within object's create() and

Zifnab 'foo

Ohara changed all FUNC doc tags to FUNCTION

Ohara COMPAT_BUSTER: //:FUNC is no longer recognised by the doc_d .. it was only used in 3 files, so it shouldn't be too major a shock :)

Ohara Enchromed trans.

Ohara removed the message from /data/config/welcome since it's no longer needed really :)

Zakk never play quake in linux

Ohara fixed the bug where wizzes would die ... some doof called heal_us() which would NOT increase hit points when hp <= 0 ...

Ohara fixed all cases of immediatly_acessible in the lib.

Ohara added handling for drop notanobject

Ohara chaged news so that it no longer prints Invis peoples' name as "Someone"

Ohara changed DID_D to not use "Someone" when you're invisible (Note: If this fails, it could be embarrrrrassing :)

Beek changed /cmds/players/i.c to inventory.c, and added 'i' as an alias.

Ohara fixed I and DID_D to only allow full wizzes to use them.

Ohara changed flist to return alphabetically.

Ohara added screen widths ... currently you need to use @this_user()->set_screen_width( whatever ) ... I strongly urge figures greater than 10 ( even 40 is pushing the useability) .. the "width" command will work as soon as I figure out why inp(1) returns 0 :P

Ohara finished width

Ohara moved the status line to /std/body

Ohara changed the status line to use screen widths.]

Ohara fixed two bugs in lava room..

Valentino installed a brand new MONEY_D. Nifty one. :)

Valentino installed /trans/obj/admtool/money.c as interface to the money_d. ('admtool' 'c')

Valentino added a cmd 'date'. (optional flag -s for "easy-snap-line-deluxe").

Valentino put in a new 'people' cmd + manpage. (Read the man page).

Zifnab test

Zifnab fixed the problem with can_go_foo, and do_go_foo for special case exits.  however see news for more info

Valentino added a (query_userid()) to the errors channel.

Ohara added a /clear option to channels ... you need to be admin or channel moderator to use it.

Beek fixed converse to show it's output again

Rust added a default allow() to /std/body

Rust fixed it so adding quests from admtool saves once again

Rust made die() not bug w/ a too deep recursion error if you don't use corpses

Zakk finally acknowledges that armorslot stuff is in, see news.

Ohara updated version :)

Zifnab fixed the /std/sword, messages problem.  The /daemons/messages_d.c has a #if COMBAT_SIMPLE in it that was excluding the message type for t combat-sword.  I commented this out and everythign seems to be ok.  One other note is that this is the way it was in the alpha release, kind of curious wh yit just cropped up.

Ohara notes the linkdead reconnection problem is fixed. Don't Ask.

Ohara need to find somene who got the one lie bug ... I know of three ... haven't seen any in a while :)

Ohara may have fixed the oe-line status line bug thanks to Efindel .. if anyone had the problem before can you please check and let me know (IE: Rust, Efindel, Fathom <and any others>) Thanks .. ReTodo: Nice way to rip didlogs.

Ohara fixed mail reply. Obviously it's real used here since noone's bugged it here and it's been broke for a while (er news reply that is)

Rust modified BLOCKEXITS so that if the object doing the blocking doesn't have an environment, it assumes that you want to block in this_object()

Zifnab reinstalled the old money_d, the new one is cool and all but it didnt work with existing stuff.

Zifnab will look into reinstalling the new one

Deathblade did something. Really. I removed the old quota crap from SECURE_D.

Rust installed Wraith's pull verb

Ohara fixed Move Post in news ..

Ohara fixed who in login to be nice for only one person on, and streamlined a bit.

Ohara fixed a bug where guet doing !whatever would dump back to login ... modal_pop() was missing,

Beek fixed a bug in putting together 'x, y, or z' lists in parser error messages

Ohara changed news so that catching up (c) a group will send you to the next group with unread news.

Ohara fixed MOVE_NOT_RECIEVED to MOVE_NOT_RECEIVED (ta Servo)

Ohara removed the spare door from wizroom. Beek fixed the bug that it demonstrated :)

Ohara changed news so that you can now do news <group> from shell.

Deathblade fixed IMAIL_D to send a string for the mail contents, not an array of strings. Tweaked MAIL_D->send_mail() to accept a string for the body (and explode it).

Ohara merged the logins and quits -> logins ... gosh it was simple :)

Ohara did help for question, and updated idea/bug/typo

Ohara did the mods to soul_d /cmds/wiz ->CMD_*

Zifnab fixed m_actions so that say foo works again

Ohara fixed the "do you mean one of the sword or the blah" error.

Ohara fixed news so that newsgroups with deadd news past the high water mark are not marked as unread. There's probably a better way, but this was fairly efficient as far as new code goes (more efficient would be to replace the call. FFF :)

Ohara fixed  LOT of typos in the message daemon.

Ohara slashed reporter.typos, but will refrain from slashing behemoth.leaks

Ohara fixed doors not to be autotaken.

Ohara tweaked the sword of mercy's names.

Ohara added "feedback", which posts to lima.discussion ...

Ohara alphabetised flist -i <obj> .. ufortunately this required the reversal of file and function. LWI or FFF :)

Zifnab installed valentino's people command, making the deafult look like the old people

Deathblade installed Barnes' updates to admtool's banish code. Much more "admtool-ish". New option, too: Nuke and Pave.

Deathblade also tweaked admtool.c's check for admin status for banish and moved that into the banish.c file like all the others.

Zifnab made it so taht ghosts cannot be attacked

Zifnab rephrases that last didlog, attacking a ghost gives a meaningful message now

Zifnab made it sot hat ghosts cannot cast spells

Ohara converted all the mixed * in /cmds/verbs/ to mixed array

Beek fixed /std/body so IT LOADS; Ohara be more careful when converting things

Zifnab made it so that players don't see I3 channels in chanlist

Ohara changed the mixed array in the verbs/verb_ob to array. AFAIK this entirely failed to hose anything .. this time :)

Zakk would like to know on why when a person uses /.rhosts within a DNS network,

Zakk am unable to find the RFC that discusses this. Yes I do know that this

Zakk hates mouse misfires with weird stuff in the buffer.

Ohara changed admtool's security dir listing to check for directory existance.

Beek removed the check_vision() call from diagnose

Deathblade fixed OOB error handling. the packet was malformed. Thanx to Tim@Dysfunctional Mud for finding this.

Ohara shortened idle format somewhat.

Zifnab fixed the log in problem.  it was a "" in the banished names list

Deathblade fixed sparse_obj to not insert its master into a room (or whatever) when it got loaded

Ohara fixed two mail bugs: 1/ Decapsed the To-list to ensure that To: OHaRa would work, and 2/ removing non-existant people it was sent to.

Ohara fixed wall <noarg>

Ohara ripped the #ifdef CONF_IN_PROGRESS lines (3!) since the CONF_D has vanished and probably won't be back.

Ohara fixed people to space correctly on players.

Ohara removed the fix .. it added a nasty problem.
