Vette added USE_MON_LEVEL, USE_TEAMS, USE_SIMPLE_EXP to config.h for use with new modules to be placed soon

Vette added /std/body/simple_exp.c and inherit support within /std/body.c

Beek fixed write() to check if things end in \n before passing them to debug_message() [which adds a \n anyway]

Beek changed how room state info works.  You now put $statename somewhere in the long description, instead of having things appended to the end.

Vette think I've got all the bugs out of boards, feel free to clone em and try to break em

Vette added support for mon-levels, mon-races, and teams.  Added 3 defines to config.h and 3 inherits in monster.c based on those defines

Vette added /cmds/verbs/stand.c support for standing in and on objects

Vette added a portable board object to /domains/std/objects in portable_board.c

Vette added support for set_objects( (["../apple":1]) );  into /std/container.c.  Was just adding an evaluate_path() around the filename

Vette ifdef'd EVERYTHING_SAVES on the add_save in m_openable

Zifnab limited titles to 65 characters

Beek fixed set_attached(0)

Vette added guest allowance during #define NO_NEW_PLAYERS  (addguest,removeguest,whoguests)  /daemon/guest_d and a few lines added to /secure/user/login.c

Vette added support for rebuilding the autodoc databases into the admtool right next to the help rebuild  (suggest only rare use)

Vette added /wiz/ and /contrib/ to the filtered dirs in doc_d. (If you have reason they NEED to be in there im happy to discuss)

Vette fixed that stupid finger bug in the player menu

Ohara notes that stairs (etc) now take relative paths .. ain't evaluate_path() funky.

Vette added "switch to next" and "post followup with <id>" in boards  (see help boards)  Included update to /cmds/verbs/post.c

Vette added /trans/cmds/diff.c  Its not too pretty but it does the job.

Vette made sure there was help file/autodoc on all /trans/cmds/  only in,testargs,xargs lack help

Ohara added is_food() to FOOD in preparation for vendor. Wow .. one line func :)

Ohara notes that on_clone now passes args.

Ohara notes that stairs and derivatives use relative paths of their _initial_environment_ (hence the stairs in the Wizroom take args of "Shop" and "Attic". having relative paths from /std/stairs is somewhat pointless :) [naturally one can use abs paths]

Ohara ripped unused variables from /trans/cmds

Ohara tweaked SIGN

Ohara added PARAM_OBJ: Use it when you want to have a number of objects that clone from the same file and only differ by the base id passed. (The actual code involved is minor, but it's far far easier to think "inherit PARAM_OBJ" that do a new(...))

Ohara notes that things which inherit M_OPENABLE are by default CLOSED

Ohara notes that all /domains/std set_closed(1) lines are ripped.

Ohara fixed knock on door to at least work. Could be beautified a touch.

Ohara tweaked the Wizroom desc so that it wasn't quite so awkward.

Vette begins to merge the current m_vendor and Darklord's m_vendor

Zakk fixed ftpd and friends.

Ohara moved the help for pipe to xargs

Ohara added absolute_path to sefun/path.c .. it takes a relative path and (optional) base object and returns an absolute path: used in /std/stairs.

Deathblade patched up the "tail" command to not barf indiscriminately on files that are too large.

Deathblade torched the "extra_short" hook. Extra bits after the description are handled by /std/object/attributes now, which looks at objects' flags. Updated M_WEARABLE, M_WIELDABLE, M_LIGHTABLE, M_OPENABLE, and inv_list() in the sefun. Note that this fixes the synchronization bug w/ loading these obs and the relevant hooks.

Deathblade wanted to note that people that have objects with M_OPENABLE in their saved inventory will not load correctly because the "closed" variable is now missing. Just "su" after you fail to load :-)  (you may need to go to the wizroom, too)

Deathblade tweaked the admtool banish and colour code per various postings.

Ohara moved bite.c to eat.c

Ohara feature enhanced nickname a little (it now lowercases to pick up id [Beek]) and reports your nickname if you have one if you give no arg.

Ohara installed Val's fix for force <player>

Deathblade purged about 300 people who haven't logged on in the past 60 days.

Vette installed updated m_vendor, shopkeeper, and new room rooms/storage (optional use).  See top of m_vendor and other objs for details

Vette notes buy.c was moved from /cmds/verbs to /cmds/player b/c of its funky parsing rules (speak to Darklord on it).  New command: /cmds/player/list.c (for vendor) and updated /cmds/verbs/sell.c

Ohara added a "the" to the knock message. WFW.

Ohara tweaked lie.c a touch.

Ohara notes that KEY now has set_key_type .. use it ratehr than overloading get_key_type (key_type moved to get_key_type() as well)

Ohara notes that knock_knock in M_KNOCKABLE is not knock() [petty change, but alignment of object functions with verb names is a Good Thing (*TM) :]

Ohara notes that M_EDIBLE/FOOD now has a default num_eats of 1.

Ohara notes that default container capacity is now LARGE

Ohara added someone_didnt() to DID_D. No interface to it yet tho.

Ohara added is_torch() to TORCH (needed because one needs to differentiate between a kerosene fueled torch and a battery fuelled torch :)

Ohara er is_flame() ... added to FLAME too,

Beek fixed the NEWS_D to initialize the removed mapping for new groups

Vette added /std/monster/wear.c  Supports new do_wear(ob) and set_wearable(string file) funs.

Vette added set_wieldable(string file) to std/monster/wield.c   Clones/moves/wields a new object.  useful for putting in setup() of mons

Vette changed this_body()->simple_action() to environment()->simple_action() in m_wearable  to give correct output when a monster wears armor

Vette notes that M_ACTIONS doesn't need to be inherited by monsters who use set_wieldable() and set_wearable()

Vette added platemail to the fighter_master2.c and made him wear it using new set_wearable()  also changed his sword to use set_wieldable()

Vette made the troll use set_wieldable()

Vette updated score.c to give level and exp output if they are so defined in the mudlib

Vette updated stats to show cash on hand

Vette added support for level and exp on the stats command.  (Players like to see everything in one command)

Ohara installed a mini-non-quest in the attic, utilises a few modified versions of /domains/std objects.

Ohara notes that default fuel for M_LIGHTABLE objects is 400 (seconds).

Ohara fixed one of the exit msg bugs (a simple_action rather than a tell_from_inside(last_loc) was used ...

Vette changed set_wieldable() and set_wearable() to set_wielding() and set_wearing()

Ohara fixed wh.c and moved it to where.c .. It locates members who aren't on and who don'ty exist as well now.

Ohara added a very temporary exit message to the wizroom to show how to use a message for the player and the room being left. Seadreamer owes me 3 Zorkmids and a packet of crisps.

Ohara notes that give_new_obj now takes relative paths.

Ohara reimplemented INF_SUPPLY: Only objects with -1 are infinite now, you can use relative paths, and you can usse parameterised objects [use "foo" : ({ -1, .... })]

Ohara notes that you can now use "yes" and "no" on existing user login ..

Ohara fixed the kenobi error in shell history ..

Ohara notes that set_wearing/wielding now use give_new_obj() ... WFW

Ohara notes that give_new_obj() now returns the object or errors (as opposed to either returning nothing or erroring :)

Zakk will most likely

Ohara notes that 1/ wearmsg is by default "$N $vwear a $o", and 2/ That M_WEARABLE now USES wearmsg ... see /domains/std/chainmail for a terribly thrilling example.

Ohara notes that /std/flame now has is_lit(){return 1;}

Ohara fixed a minor bug in ls* that wasn't apparant very often.

Ohara added a whole bunch of lima.todo.* groups to sync with lima.bugs.* .. expect posts to be moved there ...

Ohara notes that absolute_path now takes either a string or an object as its relative_to

Ohara notes taht showtree now takes relative paths

Vette retrofitted doc_d with :TODO and :LIMA tags as mentioned in lima.contrib  help autodoc updated in perspective, dirs to /help/autotodoc added accordingly

Vette added two #defines in config.h for the :LIMA tag

Ohara cleaned up the navigation room and small dock area/items

Ohara notes that 1/ vsupport now has direct_press_obj(){return useless().. in it; press() in objects now is do_press() [expect all to align with do_foo eventually]; 3/ do_press does NOT return anything - the stuff that used to be handled by do_press_obj()

Ohara ... is now in direct_press_obj. Ditto for direct_push_obj(). Oh yeah .. /std/object/vsupport.c now inherits M_PARSING

Ohara notes that eat() is now do_eat() .. M_EDIBLE and FOOD updated ..

Ohara notes that lock()/unlock() is now do_unlock()/do_lock(). M_LOCKABLE updated ..

Ohara notes that disturb() is now do_move() in /cmds/verbs/move [hasn't actually been USED anywhere yet]

Ohara notes that knock now uses do_knock() - M_KNOCKABLE and DOOR updated.

Ohara fixed FLAME to work with set_source .. ugh :)

Beek added echom and emotem commands; they allow you to do messages from the command line.  Examples: "echom @deathblade $Ts $v1die", "emotem @zif kicks $p1 ass"

Beek added /std/nverb_ob.c; improved version of verb_ob.c

Beek updated some verbs to use NVERB_OB; see 'eat' and 'diagnose' for example

Ohara notes that error messages for verbs now no longer need a \n on the end of the returned string .. So Rip Rip Rip :) [file changed was /std/body/cmd]

Ohara reimped search. M_SEARCHABLE to be updated, but the interface is there and clean ...

Ohara added back the do_unlock_obj() to unlock until it fails to bug :)

Ohara notes: ditto for lock

Ohara notes that armor now also ids to the One True Spelling: "armour"

Ohara notes that direct_flip_[off/on]_obj in M_SWITCHABLE now returns the values from direct_flip_obj_[off/on], hence you only need to overload the latter functions.

Ohara ripped the create() from M_SWITCHABLE due to its utter obscenity. Direct_flip_obj will work again sometime as soon as someone works out why there's a precidence problem.

Ohara fixed the lantern so that it can't be both lit and turned on, etc. In the process, all hook calls were ripped. Yay.

Ohara notes that there is now a LANTERN base object.

Ohara notes that giving objects that you're holding to yourself is now caught

Zifnab puthe fix into /cmds/player/ansi.c that fritti posted about

Ohara fixed the backpacks using an absolutely eeeeeeeevil hack to their ob_state() [It's the only sane thing I could think of, FF to change]

Ohara fixed up listen. In the process, listen STR was removed due to the soul clash/precedence prob. sound() is now do_listen(), Wizroom updated.

Ohara notes that if USE_RACES is deffed, and number of races is 1, it will now be selected automatically. (hopefully .. it compiles, but hasn't been tested :) ..

Ohara notes that you can now use negative numbers in shell history to use relative history commands - ie %-2 will execute your second last command.

Beek changed 'semote' to use a blank instead of 'slowly' for STR rules; much less confusing for rules where the STR isn't meant to be an adverb.

Ohara notes that M_LOCKABLE now catches locking when something is open (technically it should probably handle locking things open, but that gets very ugly very fast.

Beek added function pointer support to /std/portal.c; also got rid of funky fun () { ... } spacing

Ohara fixed a newsreader search bug

Ohara removed the M_MESSAGES inherit from DOOR

Zifnab fixed the problem with triggers.  Had to do with the ansi being sent in says.  I stripped the ansi and triggers seem to work fine again

Zifnab added a check to beep for a shell var no_beep.  (set no_beep)  got sick and tired of being beeped today.

Beek updated 'help donate' a bit

Beek merged in Andrew's channel-t support
