The admtool command is very essential to running a Lima mud!  You can
use it to make people full wizards.  You *need* to use it to change
security levels.  Definitly check it out.


Also, if you're interested in building your own menus, check out:
/obj/shells/plmenu.c

It should be pretty easy, except for maybe the stuff between (:  :).

If you want some help with that, come ask Rust or post news on Lima Bean.
