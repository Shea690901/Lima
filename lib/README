Welcome to the pre-alpha release of the Lima Mudlib!

To compensate for our lack of documentation, please come to our lib
support mud, Lima Bean, and ask questions (or type news and post
them there).

Lima Bean is located at:
lima.imaginary.com 7878
(198.92.143.9	7878)

Additional information is also available on our new web pages:
  http://lima.imaginary.com/


Mudlib Features:
 o Centralized natural language parsing (zork like commands for players).
	Definitly the most advancedds command parsing currently available.
 o Socials use the natural language parsing, and are easy to extend.
 	There are hundreds of socials and adverbs supplied.
 o The wizard command line does file name expansions as well as the 
	unix command line...  it's pretty handy to be able to type:
	cd /s*/m*/s* to cd to /std/mixin/shell_support
 o Inline documentation.	
 o Distributed support.
 o Very modular, with clear code.
 o Support for the new Intermud-3.
 o Modal input, and fully featured interactive shells.
 o Real, secure security authored by Ellery @ TMI-2 (Remier Behrends).
 o Emphasis on player usability:
	better news, channels, menus, etc...
	than any other mudlib
 o Easy to build menus, easy to write socials, etc...
 o A menu driven admin tool to ease routine administration tasks.
