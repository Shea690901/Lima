Welcome to Lima release 0.9 pre-alpha!

To compensate for our lack of documentation, please come to our lib
support mud, Lima Bean, and ask questions.  (Or type news and post
them). 

It's located at:
lima.imaginary.com 7878
(198.92.143.9	7878)

Mudlib Features:
 o Centralized natural language parsing (zork like commands for players).
	Definitly the most advancedds command parsing currently available.
 o Socials use the natural language parsing, and are easy to extend.
 	There are hundreds of socials and adverbs supplied.
 o The wizard command line does file name expansions as well as the 
	unix command line...  it's pretty handy to be able to type:
	cd /s*/m*/s* to cd to /std/mixin/shell_support
 o Inline documentation.	
 o Distributed support.
 o Very modular, with clear code.
 o Support for the new Intermud-3.
 o Modal input, and fully featured interactive shells.
 o Real, secure security authored by Ellery@TMI-2 (Remier Behrends).
 o Emphasis on player usability:
	better news, channels, menus, etc...
	than any other mudlib
 o Easy to build menus, easy to write socials, etc...
 o A menu driven admin tool to ease routine administration tasks.

Note:

We are aware of the fact that error messages in the parser aren't
fully implemented in MudOS yet, so don't report things like
getting ERROR_PROCESS_ANSWER back from the parser or 'There is
no X here.'.

Also, a number of the verbs aren't fully implemented or converted
yet; if you fix some of them we'd appreciate getting the fixed
files.
