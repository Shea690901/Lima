Beta will be released when we arbitrarily declare that there are no
known bugs (arbitrary meaning we reserve the right to label a bug
we're never going to fix a feature ;-)

Misc things that should be done soon or the idea discarded:
- skill examples, combat skills, spell skills, advancement
- use of parser for commands
- admtool: wizdir administration
- msg/review
- fix location of mail messages
- ambiguity on drop, throw, etc...
- organize all files properly
- modularize stats, skills, and races fully
- newsreader changes, mailer changes
- widespread nickname usage
- more ANSI usage


Features unrelated to gaming, to be included post-alpha 
(even though alpha means feature freeze):
- I3: OOB services, better channels
- time zone support
- possibly water/underwater rooms

Future versions (Post 1.0):
- mail unsend
- Tk interface
- AMCP
- conversion of SECURE_D to array of paths, not a tree
- RCP
