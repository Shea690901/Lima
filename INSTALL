How to install Lima:

1) You must compile the driver for your machine.
	a) cd to the driver directory
	b) type: ./build.MudOS
	c) Type either "gmake install" or "make install", depending on
	   what the last line of buld.MudOS tells you.
	d) When this is finished, you should have a driver and an
	   addr_server in ../etc
	
2) You must edit the mudlib configuration file.
	a) cd ../etc
	b) edit config.lima   and  change all the lines that say:

	## Change the next line!
	
   You may also change lines that say:

	## Change the next line if you want
   
3) Start the driver with the command:
	./driver config.lima &

   Your mud should now be starting up.  When it says:
	Accepting connections on port NNNN.

   Then your mud is up.

4) Log in to your mud.  Make sure you're the first person to do so --
   whoever is first will become an admin.  After that, new users will
   just be guest wizards.

   Connect to the mud, type a name, password, etc.  Once you are logged
   in, you should be a full admin.  To verify this, type:
	checkpriv 1

   It should come back with:
	Verified.  You have privilege '1'

5) You can convert other wizards after they log in into admins by adding
   them into the "admin" domain.  Use the "admtool" command for this.

6) change any options you feel appropriate in /include/config.h
   reboot the mud with the shutdown command to make those changes happen.

7) You're done! Come see us on Lima Bean (lima.imaginary.com 7878) and
   let us know how it went!

8) If your machine has /bin/bash, you can modify LIMADIR in
   /etc/backup, /etc/startmud and /etc/keepup, and follow the usage
   instructions in those scripts, if you think you'll find them useful.
