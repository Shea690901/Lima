How to install Lima:

1) Compile the driver for your machine:
	a) cd to the driver directory
	b) Type: ./configure lima
	c) When it is done running, type: make install
	d) When this is finished, you should have a driver and an
	   addr_server in ../bin

2) You must edit the mudlib configuration file.
	a) cd ../bin
	b) edit the file config.lima
	c) follow the directions in the file
        d) at a minimum you MUST change the mud name, the bin directory, and the lib directory

3) Start your address server if one isn't running already (type this while
   you're in the "etc" directory):
	./addr_server 9990 &

   Change the port number above as needed, ensuring that the config.lima
   file matches the command line used to start the address server.

4) Start the driver with the command (type this while in the "etc"
   directory):
	./driver ./config.lima &

   Your mud should now be starting up.  When it says:
	Accepting connections on port NNNN.

   Then your mud is up.

5) Log in to your mud.  Make sure you're the first person to do so --
   whoever is first will become an admin!  After that, new users will
   just be guest wizards (by default).

   Connect to the mud, type a name, password, etc.  Once you are logged
   in, you should be a full admin.  To verify this, type:
	checkpriv 1

   It should come back with:
	Verified.  You have privilege '1'

   In order to access all the admin commands, you will need to type:
	resetpath

6) Creating new admins;

   You can convert other wizards after they log in into admins by adding
   them into the "admin" domain.  Use the "admtool" command for this.

7) Mudlib configuration:

   Change any options you feel appropriate in /include/config.h. 

   When you're done with any configuration changes, then shut down the
   mud with the shutdown command.  Restart it, as described above, to
   make those changes happen.

8) You're done! Share your experiences on the Lima area of http://lpmuds.net/forum

9) If your machine has /bin/bash, you can modify LIMADIR in
   /etc/backup and /etc/startmud, and follow the usage instructions in
   those scripts, if you think you'll find them useful.
