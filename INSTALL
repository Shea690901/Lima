How to install Lima:

1) You must compile the driver for your machine.
	a) cd to the driver directory
	b) type: ./build.MudOS
	c) Type either gmake or make, depending on what the last line	
	   of buld.MudOS tells you.
	d) type: mv driver ../etc/
	

2) You must edit the mudlib configuration file.
	a) cd ../etc
	b) edit config.lima   and  change all the lines that say:

	## Change the next line!
	

	you may also change lines that say:

	## Change the next line if you want
   
3) Start the driver with the command:
	./driver config.lima&

Your mud should now be starting up.

4) When it says:' Accepting connections', it's up.
Log in to your mud.  When it asks you for your name, type:
	admin
   Your password will be:
	admin

5) from within the mud edit the file:
	/secure/daemons/group_d.c

	change the line:   
		"admin",
(The line right before "rust",)
	 to the name of the character you want to be.

6) WITHOUT LOGGING OFF AS ADMIN:
	a) log in as the character you want to be.
	b) as the admin character, type: admtool 
	c) then type: u
	d) then type: w your-admin-characters-new-name     
	   where your-admin-characters-new-name is the same as the name you
	   added to group_d in step 5.
	e) type: q to exit admtool
	f) type:  update /secure/daemons/group_d
	g) type: save      as your admin char
	h) type: quit      as your admin char
	g) type: shutdown  as admin


7) Restart the mud and log back on as your admin character.  He should
	be an full admin now, able to edit anything, anywhere. You can
	go back to the admtool, and nuke the admin character.

8) change any options you feel appropriate in /include/config.h
   reboot the mud with the shutdown command to make those changes happen.

9) You're done! Come see us on Lima Bean (lima.imaginary.com 7878) and
   let us know how it went!

10) If your machine has /bin/bash, you can modify LIMADIR in
/etc/backup, /etc/startmud and /etc/keepup, and follow the usage
instructions in those scripts, if you think you'll find them useful.
