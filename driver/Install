Complete installation instructions are available in major releases
(as opposed to minor releases).  The major releases also contain
documentation, etc.

Short instructions:

1) edit options.h to suit your tastes
2) type: ./build.MudOS
3) follow the instructions printed on the screen
4) you will need a runtime config file and a mudlib in order to use the driver.
5) look at the example config file in this directory (Config.example)
6) get a MudOS-compatible mudlib such as the TMI-2 or Nightmare and read the
   instructions that come with it.
7) have fun.
